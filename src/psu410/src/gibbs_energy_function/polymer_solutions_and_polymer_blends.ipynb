The number of\nrepeating units is called the degree of polymerization and can be as\nlarge as 10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup>. It defines the molecular mass,\ni.e. the mass of one polymer molecule. There are three typical\narchitectures of polymerization: a linear chain, a branched chain, and a\ncross-linked polymer. Nearly all polymers are mixtures of molecules with\na different degree of polymerization with a molecular mass distribution,\ncomplicating the modeling of their thermodynamic properties because of\nthe dependence of properties on molecular mass.\n\nGibbs energy functions of polymers with a single molecular mass can be\ntreated similarly as in Chapter . For a polymer solution, the ideal\nentropy of mixing is quite different from that of atomically random\nsolutions discussed in Chapter because the monomers in a polymer\nmolecule are connected to each other and cannot move freely. One common\napproach to calculate the ideal entropy of mixing is to evoke a lattice\nmodel and assume that one monomer occupies a lattice site with a fixed\nvolume. The number of translational states of a single molecule is equal\nto the number of lattice sites available. In a homogeneous solution, the\ntotal number of lattice sites available is\n\nEq. \u2011 $n = \\sum_{i}^{}{m_{i}n_{i}}$\n\nwhere $n_{i}$ and $m_{i}$ are the number of molecule $i$ and the number\nof lattice sites per molecule $i$, respectively. While in its pure\nstate, i.e. before mixing, the number of states of molecule $i$ in terms\nof the number of lattice sites is\n\nEq. \u2011 $w_{i} = m_{i}n_{i} = n\\varphi_{i}$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{i}$ is the volume fraction of molecule $i$ in the\nsolution. The entropy change per molecule $i$ is thus\n\nEq. \u2011\n$S_{i} = kln(n) - klnw_{i} = kln\\frac{1}{\\varphi_{i}} = - kln\\varphi_{i}$\n\nThe total entropy of mixing is the summation for all molecules,\nnormalized to per mole of lattice site\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{}^{I}S_{m} = \\frac{N_{a}}{n}\\sum_{i}^{}{n_{i}S_{i}} = - R\\sum_{i}^{}{\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}\\ln\\varphi_{i}}$\n\nwhere $N_{a}$ is the Avogadro number. When $m_{i} = 1$ for all\nmolecules, Eq. 2\u2011143 reduces to . Since $m_{i}$ values are typically\nvery large numbers for polymers, the entropy of mixing in polymer\nsolutions and blends is thus significantly lower than those in\nnon-polymer solutions as shown schematically in for binary systems with\nvarious $m_{i}$ values.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic entropy of mixing in solutions with the numbers of\nlattice sites per molecule shown.\n\nSimilar to , Gibbs energy of a multi-component random polymer\nsolution/blend can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = \\sum_{}^{}\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}_{\\ }^{0}G_{im} + RT\\left( \\sum_{}^{}{\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}\\ln\\varphi_{i}} + \\sum_{}^{}{\\varphi_{i}\\varphi_{j}\\chi_{ij}} \\right)$\n\nwhere $_{\\ }^{0}G_{im}$ is the Gibbs energy of molecular $i$ per mole of\nlattice site, and $\\chi_{ij}$ the unitless interaction parameter between\nmolecule $i$ and $j$. Other equations shown in Chapter can be derived\nsimilarly too. It is to be noted that is very similar to the\nFlory\u2013Huggins solution equation widely used in the polymer community.\n",

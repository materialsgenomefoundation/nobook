A phase can be represented by a *c+1*-dimensional surface\nin a *c+2*-dimensional space of potentials based on the Gibbs-Duhem\nequation. The directions and curvature of the surface are represented by\nthe partial derivatives shown by and secondary derivatives shown by ,\nboth being negative for a stable phase. To develop a mathematical\nformula for Gibbs energy of a phase with variable compositions, one can\nconsider a phase as a mixture of independent components that the phase\nis made of. Its Gibbs energy function can be postulated as the summation\nof Gibbs energy of the independent components of the same structure of\nthe solution, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}$, plus the contribution due to the mixing,\n$_{\\ }^{mixing}G$ or $_{\\ }^{M}G$\n\nEq. \u2011 $G = \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}} +_{\\ }^{M}G$\n\nSince the system size usually is not important in thermodynamics, its\nproperties are typically normalized to one mole with its composition\nrepresented by mole fractions of components.

As $x_{i}$ is\nsmaller than unity, the entropy production to form an ideal solution\nfrom pure components is thus positive, indicating that it is a\nspontaneous process. In such an ideal solution, it is assumed that there\nare no interactions between components, and the enthalpy of mixing is\nthus zero as the internal energy and the volume of the system do not\nchange. The ideal Gibbs energy of mixing is written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $_{\\ }^{I}G = - T_{\\ }^{I}S_{m} = RT\\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}l{nx}_{i}}$\n\nThe Gibbs energy of real solutions, i.e. , becomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = \\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}} + RT\\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}l{nx}_{i}} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$\n\nFrom , the chemical potential is obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} = G_{i} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{i} + RTlnx_{i} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} + \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}}$\n\nFrom the chemical activity of , the activity coefficient, $\\gamma_{i}$,\ncan be defined as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\gamma_{i} = \\frac{a_{i}}{x_{i}} = \\frac{1}{x_{i}}\\exp\\frac{G_{i} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}\\ }{RT}$\n\nThe solution is an ideal solution with $\\gamma_{i} = 1$, and is said to\nbe positively or negatively deviating from an ideal solution with\n$\\gamma_{i} > 1$ or $\\gamma_{i} < 1$, respectively.

The partial derivatives in\nrepresent the directions of molar Gibbs energy in the composition space,\ni.e. the tangents of molar Gibbs energy with respect to mole fractions\nof independent components. Collectively, they define the\nmulti-dimensional tangent plane of molar Gibbs energy at the given\ncomposition, $x_{i}^{0}$.

It is self-evident\nthat both and hold for stable binary solutions too, i.e. the directions\nand the curvature of the surface are all negative. To visualize the\nfour-dimensional surface in the three-dimensional space, one needs to\nfix one of the four potentials.

One can\ntypically investigate behaviors of systems consisting of condensed\nphases by varying the temperature at constant pressure. at constant\npressure thus becomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - SdT - {N_{A}d\\mu}_{A} - {N_{B}d\\mu}_{B}$\n\nSimilar to and , the property of a phase can be represented by a\ntwo-dimensional surface in the three-dimensional space composed of $T$,\n$\\mu_{A}$, and $\\mu_{B}$ under constant $P$, keeping in mind the\nfollowing\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = x_{A}\\mu_{A} + x_{B}\\mu_{B} = x_{A}_{\\ }^{0}G_{A} + x_{B}_{\\ }^{0}G_{B} + RT\\left( x_{A}l{nx}_{A} + x_{B}l{nx}_{B} \\right) +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$\n\nSince $_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$ must be zero for pure components $A$ and $B$, it\nneeds to be in the following form\n\nEq. \u2011 $_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} = x_{A}x_{B}L_{AB}$\n\nwith $L_{AB}$ being a parameter denoting the interaction between\ncomponents $A$ and $B$, called interaction parameter. When $L_{AB} = 0$,\nthe solution is an ideal solution. When $L_{AB}$ is a non-zero constant\nindependent of temperature and composition, the solution is called a\nregular solution. Its excess entropy and excess enthalpy of mixing are\nobtained as\n\nEq. \u2011 $_{\\ }^{E}S_{m} = \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial T} = 0$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{E}H_{m} =_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} - T_{\\ }^{E}S_{m} = x_{A}x_{B}L_{AB}$\n\nThe chemical potential of component $A$ or $B$ in a binary regular\nsolution can be derived as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{i} + RTlnx_{i} + \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)^{2}L_{AB}$\n\nIn a dilute solution with $x_{i} \\rightarrow 0$, one can have\n\nEq. \u2011\n$RTln\\gamma_{i} = \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)^{2}L_{AB} \\approx L_{AB}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma_{i} = e^{\\frac{L_{AB}}{RT}}$\n\nThe activity is thus proportional to its mole fraction, which is called\nHenry\u2019s law.

There are\nvarious approaches in the literature to consider the composition\ndependence of $L_{AB}$.

Using the mole of component\n$C$ as the independent molar quantity, the limit of stability is\nexpresses as\n\nEq. \u2011 $G_{AA}G_{BB} - G_{AB}G_{BA} = 0$\n\nAs an example, $G_{AA}$ is shown in the following equation, which must\nbe positive for the solution to be stable\n\nEq. \u2011\n${N\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}} \\right)}_{T,P,N_{B},N_{C}} = NG_{AA} = \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - x_{A} \\right)}{x_{A}} - 2x_{B}^{2}L_{AB} - 2x_{C}^{2}L_{AC} - 2x_{B}x_{C}\\left( L_{AB} + L_{AC} - L_{BC} \\right) - 2x_{B}x_{C}\\left( 2 - 3x_{A} \\right)L_{ABC}$\n\nIt is evident that any instability in binary systems with positive\ninteraction parameters extends into the ternary system. It can also be\nseen that even if all binary interaction parameters are negative, i.e.\nno instability in the binary systems, it is possible that becomes\nnegative for some combinations of the binary interaction parameters such\nthat $\\mathrm{\\Delta}L = L_{AB} + L_{AC} - L_{BC}$ becomes very positive\nand overshadows the contributions due to $L_{AB}$ and $L_{AC}$, i.e.\n$L_{BC}$ is more negative than $L_{AB}$ and $L_{AC}$ combined. In an\nextreme case with $L_{AB} = L_{AC} = L_{ABC} = 0$ and $L_{BC} < 0$, i.e.\nideal solutions for the $A - B$ and $A - C$ binary systems, stable\nsolution in the $B - C$ binary system, and no additional ternary\ninteraction, reduces to\n\nEq. \u2011\n$N\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{B},N_{C}} = \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - x_{A} \\right)}{x_{A}} + 2x_{B}x_{C}L_{BC}$\n\nSetting\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{B},N_{C}} = 0$,\none obtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$- \\frac{RT}{2L_{BC}} = \\frac{x_{A}x_{B}x_{C}}{1 - x_{A}} = \\frac{{\\left( 1 - x_{B} - x_{C} \\right)x}_{B}x_{C}}{x_{B} + x_{C}}$\n\nWith $- \\frac{RT}{2L_{BC}}$ being positive due to $L_{BC} < 0$, there is\na parabola-shaped composition area in which the solution is unstable at\nconstant temperature and pressure. This is reasonable because the system\ntends to maximize the number of B-C bonds due to its lower energy, which\ncompetes with the entropy of mixing among the three elements and results\nin segregation of B-C bonds, thus miscibility gap at low temperatures.\n\nTo evaluate the ternary consolute point, the second derivatives for\ncomponent A and B are obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n${N\\left( \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}^{2}} \\right)}_{T,P,N_{B},N_{C}} = \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - x_{A} \\right)}{x_{A}^{2}} + 4x_{B}^{2}L_{AB} + 4x_{C}^{2}L_{AC} + 4x_{B}x_{C}\\left( L_{AB} + L_{AC} - L_{BC} \\right) + 2x_{B}x_{C}\\left( 7 - 9x_{A} \\right)L_{ABC} = 0$\n\nEq. \u2011\n${N\\left( \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}\\mu_{B}}{\\partial N_{B}^{2}} \\right)}_{T,P,N_{A},N_{C}} = \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - x_{B} \\right)}{x_{B}^{2}} + 4x_{A}^{2}L_{AB} + 4x_{C}^{2}L_{BC} + 4x_{A}x_{C}\\left( L_{AB} + L_{BC} - L_{AC} \\right) + 2x_{A}x_{C}\\left( 7 - 9x_{B} \\right)L_{ABC} = 0$\n\nThe consolute point can then be obtained using , and .\n\nIt is observed in that $\\left( 1 - 2x_{A} \\right)L_{ABC} = 0$ at\n$x_{A} = 0.5$, i.e. the ternary interaction parameter does not\ncontribute to the chemical potential of $A$. It is also observed in that\nthe contribution from the ternary interaction parameter changes sign at\n$x_{i} = 2/3$ due to $\\left( 2 - 3x_{A} \\right)L_{ABC} = 0$.\n",

For\nsimplicity, let us consider only the pairs between nearest neighbors\nwith the correlation function represented by the pair probability of\nnearest neighbor bonds between two components.

      "source": "### Solutions with long-range ordering\n\nSo far, solutions in which a component can occupy any site in a phase\nare discussed. In many phases, this is not the case. For example, in the\nfcc solid solution of Fe and C, Fe atoms take the fcc lattice sites, and\nC atoms occupy the interstitial sites between the fcc lattice sites.\nTherefore, Fe atoms do not mix with C atoms on the fcc lattice sites,\nand they rather develop long-rang ordering by occupying their own\ndistinct sites in the phase. Long-range ordering can also develop when\nshort-range ordering extends to the whole lattice. New formula for the\nGibbs energy of mixing is needed by considering the details how\ncomponents are distributed and mixed in various sites in a phase.\n\nOne way to group various sites in a phase is based on equivalent\ncrystallographic positions in a phase, i.e. Wyckoff positions. Various\nsets of equivalent positions divide the lattice into sub-sets of\nlattices. Each set of equivalent positions forms a sublattice. The\ndistributions of components on each sublattice can be represented by\nmole fractions of components in the sublattice, commonly referred to as\nsite fractions and defined as\n\nEq. \u2011 $y_{i}^{t} = \\frac{N_{i}^{t}}{\\sum_{j}^{}N_{j}^{t}}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\sum_{i}^{}y_{i}^{t} = 1$\n\nwhere the superscript $t$ denotes the sublattice in which the component\nresides, and the summation is for all species in sublattice $t$\nincluding vacancy. Site fractions and mole fractions are related through\nthe mass balance as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$x_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}y_{i}^{t}}}{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}\\left( 1 - y_{va}^{t} \\right)}}$\n\nwhere $a^{t}$ and $y_{va}^{t}$ are the number of sites and the site\nfraction of vacancy in the sublattice *t*.\n\nRandom solutions form when each component enters all sublattices\nequally. Mole fractions and site fractions thus become identical.\nSolutions with both substitutional and interstitial component, like the\nfcc Fe-C solution mentioned above, can be represented by two\nsublattices. Stoichiometric compounds have its site fractions equal to\nunity in each sublattice. When site fractions in a compound deviate from\nunity, the compound is no longer stoichiometric and develops a\ncomposition range of homogeneity. When the composition range is small,\nthe deviations are often referred to as defects. Since many properties\nof a compound are determined by defects, a distinct field of defect\nchemistry exists, predominantly for charged species. As will be\ndemonstrated in Chapter and the rest of the book, defects can be treated\nas an integral part of the thermodynamics of a phase with more than one\nsublattices.\n\nLet us consider a case where there is only one component in each\nsublattice, which represents one possible stoichiometric composition of\nthe phase and is often called an end-member of the phase. The Gibbs\nenergy of an end-member is the same as that of a phase with a fixed\ncomposition shown by or or . By re-arranging , Gibbs energy of an\nend-member, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{em}$, is obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{0}G_{em} = \\sum_{t}^{}{a^{t}{_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{t,ref}} + \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}G_{em}$\n\nwhere ${_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{t,ref}$ represents the Gibbs energy of\ncomponent $i$ in a given reference state which occupies sublattice $t$\nin the end-member. For vacancy, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{Va} = 0$ is defined. The\ncontribution of each end-member to the Gibbs energy of the phase is the\nproduct of site fraction of each component in their respective\nsublattices and the Gibbs energy of the end-member per mole of formula\nunit (*mf*), i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{0}G_{mf} = \\sum_{em}^{}\\left( \\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{em} \\right)$\n\nThe ideal mixing in each sublattice is similar to that in a random\nsolution with mole fractions substituted by site fractions. The excess\nGibbs energy of mixing consists of two contributions: (i) the mixing in\none sublattice with all other sublattices containing only one component\nin each sublattice and (ii) the mixing simultaneously in more than one\nsublattices. The Gibbs energy of a solution phase with multi-sublattices\ncan thus be written in terms of per mole of formula unit as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{mf} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{mf} + RT\\sum_{t}^{}{a^{t}\\sum_{i}^{}{y_{i}^{t}\\ln y_{i}^{t}}} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$\n\nwith $_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$ given by\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf} = \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}L_{i,j:l}^{t}}}} + \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j > k}^{}{\\sum_{k}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}y_{k}^{t}L_{i,j,k:l}^{t}}}}} + \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t,u}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j > k}^{}{\\sum_{k}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}y_{m}^{u}y_{n}^{u}L_{i,j:m,n:l}^{t}}}}}$\n\nThe first term in represents the binary interaction between component\n$i$ and $j$ in sublattice $t$ with sublattice $s$ occupied by component\n$l$ with comma separating interacting components in one sublattice and\ncolon separating sublattices. The product,\n$\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}$, runs through all other sublattices with\none component in each sublattice, except sublattice $t$ in which the\ninteraction is considered. The second term denotes the ternary\ninteraction among $i$, $j$, and $k$ in sublattice $t$ with sublattice\n$s$ occupied by component $l$. The third term depicts the interactions\nsimultaneously in both sublattice $t$ and $u$, and the product runs\nthrough all other sublattices with one component in each sublattice,\nexcept sublattice $t$ and $u$ in which the interactions are considered.\nThe third term thus partially reflects the short-range ordering among\ncomponents between two sublattices. In principles, high-order\ninteraction parameters such as quaternary, quinary, and multiple\nsublattice interaction parameters could be added, but their\ncontributions to $_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$ are small due to the physical\ninsignificance of co-location of four or five components indicated by\nthe product of their site fractions in front of the interaction\nparameters.\n\nIn , the chemical potential of a stoichiometric compound was defined in\nterms of a summation of chemical potential of individual components in\nthe compound because the relative amounts of components are constrained\nby the stoichiometry of the compound and chemical potentials of\nindividual components can not vary independently. By the same token, the\nchemical potential of an end-member in a solution can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\mu_{em} = G_{em} = \\sum_{t}^{}a^{t}\\mu_{i}^{t}$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{i}^{t}$ is the chemical potential of component $i$ that\noccupies the sublattice $t$ in the end-member, and can be derived using\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i}^{t} = a^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{t,ref} + a^{t}RTlny_{i}^{t} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ } + \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ }}{\\partial y_{i}^{t}} - \\sum_{j}^{\\ }y_{j}^{t}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ }}{\\partial y_{j}^{t}}$\n\nFor constant interaction parameters in , for chemical potential reduces\nto the following expression from\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i}^{t} = a^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{t} + a^{t}RTlny_{i}^{t} + \\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{\\left( y_{i}^{t} \\right)^{2}L}_{i,j}^{t} + \\sum_{k > j}^{}{\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{y_{j}^{t}y_{k}^{t}\\left\\lbrack L_{i,j}^{t} + L_{i,k}^{t} - L_{j,k}^{t} + \\left( 1 - 2y_{i}^{t} \\right)L_{i,j,k}^{t} \\right\\rbrack}}$\n\nThe stability of the solution is defined by\n$\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{em}}{\\partial N_{em}}$ with $N_{em}$ being the moles\nof the end-member in the solution given by\n$N_{em} = N\\prod_{u}^{}y_{j}^{u}$ and\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{\\partial N_{em}}{\\partial y_{j}^{u}} = \\frac{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t}}{y_{j}^{u}\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t} \\right)}$\n\nFollowing , one obtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{em}}{\\partial N_{em}} = \\sum_{u}^{}{\\frac{\\partial\\left( \\sum_{t}^{}a^{t}\\mu_{i}^{t} \\right)}{\\partial y_{j}^{u}}\\frac{\\partial y_{j}^{u}}{\\partial N_{em}}} = \\frac{\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t} \\right)}{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t}}\\sum_{u}^{}{a^{u}y_{i}^{u}\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}^{u}}{\\partial y_{i}^{u}}} = \\frac{\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t} \\right)}{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t}}\\sum_{u}^{}{a^{u}y_{i}^{u}\\left\\{ \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - y_{i}^{u} \\right)}{y_{i}^{u}} - 2\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}\\left( y_{j}^{u} \\right)^{2}L_{i,j}^{u} - 2\\sum_{k > j}^{}{\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{y_{j}^{u}y_{k}^{u}\\left\\lbrack L_{i,j}^{u} + L_{i,k}^{u} - L_{j,k}^{u} + \\left( 2 - 3y_{i}^{u} \\right)L_{i,j,k}^{u} \\right\\rbrack}} \\right\\}}$\n\nIt is self-evident from that a site fraction is only uniquely defined\nfrom the mole fraction of the component when the component enters into\none sublattice only and does not form any associates. Therefore, in\ngeneral, the distribution of components on sublattices and different\nkinds of molecules can only be obtained by equilibrium calculations, and\nthe thermodynamic properties for such a phase can thus not be\nrepresented in a closed form using mole fractions of independent\ncomponents. This was demonstrated in Chapter when short-range ordering\nexists in solution phases, where the energy minimization procedure was\nused to obtain the distribution of components on different kinds of\nbonds and the amounts of individual associates.\n",

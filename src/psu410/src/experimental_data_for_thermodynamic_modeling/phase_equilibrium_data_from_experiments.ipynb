      "source": "### Equilibrated materials\n\nThe most common method to determine phase equilibria is to use\nequilibrated materials. This method typically involves material\npreparation through high temperature melting or powder metallurgy,\nhomogenization heat treatment, isothermal or cooling/heating procedure,\nand identifications of crystal structures and phase compositions. It is\nimportant to avoid macro-inhomogeneity as it can be difficult remove the\ninhomogeneity in subsequent treatments. It is also important to use\nstarting materials of highest purity and minimize the loss and\ncontamination of materials during the whole experiments using a\nprotective atmosphere of inert gas or vacuum. The typical melting\ntechniques include high temperature furnaces with crucibles, arc\nmelting, and induction melting. Attentions need to be paid for possible\nreactions between materials and crucibles/containers, which can be\navoided by levitating the materials through electromagnetic fields or\nother means. In addition to use pure elements as raw materials, master\nalloys with well-controlled compositions are often utilized because the\ncompositions and melting properties of master alloys are usually much\ncloser to those of final materials than the pure elements. For materials\nwith very high melting temperature or volatile components, the powder\nmetallurgy method can be used where compacts are made, capsulated, and\nsintered.\n\nHomogenization during subsequent heat treatment is achieved through\ndiffusion, in which time and temperature are two important parameters.\nTo accelerate the homogenization process, the heat treatment temperature\nshould be as close to the solidus temperature as possible taking into\naccount the composition inhomogeneity with variable solidus\ntemperatures. When there are phase transformations taking place during\nthe heat treatment, extra time is needed for the heat treatment.\n\nThe phase boundaries are then determined through measurements of either\ncompositions of individual phases that are in equilibrium under constant\ntemperature, pressure/stress/strain, and electric/magnetic fields or\ndiscontinuity in some physical properties of materials due to a phase\ntransition from the continuous change of temperature or\npressure/stress/strain or electric/magnetic fields. The measurement of\ncompositions is usually carried out at ambient conditions so it is\nnecessary that the phases are fully equilibrated at experimental\nconditions, which requires rigorous verifications, and can be \u201cquenched\u201d\nto ambient conditions to remain unaltered during \u201cquenching\u201d, at least\nin terms of compositions. The compositions are typically measured by\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive\nspectrometer (EDS) or wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS), with a\nmicro-level spatial resolution and a better compositional resolution of\nWDS than EDS. A dedicated SEM with WDS gives another important, widely\nused composition measurement technique called electron probe\nmicroanalysis (EMPA). For submicron-sized phases, analytical\ntransmission electron microscopy equipped with EDS can be used though\ncare must be taken to avoid interference from neighboring phases.\n\nTo accurately identify phases in equilibrium under experimental\nconditions, in-situ characterizations are necessary, which complicates\nthe experimentation. An alternative indirect method is to measure a\nphysical property that changes discontinuously or dramatically for a\nfirst- or second-order phase transition, such as heat, volume, electric\nconductivity, and magnetization. There are two widely used techniques in\nmeasuring heat: differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential\nscanning calorimetry (DSC). Both attempt to measure the difference in\ntemperature with the same amount of power supplied between a sample and\nan inert standard during heating or cooling. A DSC may also measure the\ndifference in the amount of power supplied to keep their temperatures\nidentical. The deviation of this difference from a baseline indicates a\nphase transition in the sample and is plotted as a function of time or\ntemperature of either the sample or the inert standard. It is evident\nthat the major challenges in both DTA and DSC techniques are to reach\nthermal equilibrium between the sample/standard and the instrument and\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium within the sample due to the continuous\nheating or cooling. The thermal equilibrium can be improved or mitigated\nthrough various methods such as sample shape and size, crucible\nselection, mixture with the material used for the inert standard, and\nwith thermocouples in direct contact with the sample and the inert\nstandard. However, the thermodynamic equilibrium within the sample can\nonly be reached when the heating/cooling rate is comparable with the\nrate of the phase transition in the sample, which is almost impossible\nif the phase transition typically involves diffusion in solid phases.\nTherefore, extreme care is needed in interpreting the temperature\ndetermination and the amount of heat associated with the DTA/DSC curves\nas discussed in detail in the reference \\[11\\].\n",

      "source": "### Diffusion couples/multiples\n\nThe major challenge in the equilibrated material approach is to ensure\nthat the whole sample reaches equilibrium. On the other hand the\ndiffusion couple/multiple technique does not require the whole sample to\nbe in equilibrium and is based on the assumption that any two phases in\ncontact are in equilibrium with each other at the phase interface, and\nthe phase compositions can be obtained by extrapolation of concentration\nprofiles in the two phases to the phase interface. Since the total\nsystem of a diffusion couple is not at equilibrium, many kinetic\nphenomena related to diffusion can be studied in a diffusion couple,\nsuch as interdiffusion coefficients, parabolic growth kinetics of\nproduct layer thickness, diffusion path (represented by the local\noverall compositions) in ternary and multi-component systems for\nvisualizing the microstructure of reaction zones, and other properties,\nall as a function of composition, which are beyond the scope of the\npresent book.\n\nTypical diffusion couples are in solid-state with two materials brought\ninto intimate contact to allow diffusion of elements between the two\nmaterials though solid-liquid diffusion couples are also used. The\ncontacting faces are commonly ground and polished flat, clamped together\nusing mechanical mechanisms, and annealed at high temperatures where\ndiffusion can take place to a significant degree in a matter of days,\nweeks or months. The samples are then quenched to retain the\nhigh-temperature equilibrium features. For metallic systems, diffusion\ncouples can also be prepared by eletrolytical and electroless plating\ntechniques. It is important to avoid the formation of liquid during\nannealing as it ruins the sample geometry. Furthermore, good adherence\nat the interfaces is critical for reliable data.\n\nSince diffusion couples are not in a fully equilibrium state, the\ntie-lines between two phases at the phase interfaces need to be obtained\nby extrapolations of concentration profiles in neighbouring phases. The\nelectron propagation in quantitative EPMA is typically in the range of\n1-2\u03bcm, yielding an excitation volume of approximately 2-4\u03bcm diameter and\na requirement of reasonable layer widths of phases on both sides of the\ninterface for accurate extrapolation. Therefore, the reliable\ncomposition of a single phase must be taken several micrometers away\nfrom the interface. When steep concentration gradients exist near the\ninterfaces, the extrapolation may lead to large errors, and analytical\nelectron microscopy is then needed. Furthermore, the fluorescence\neffects, where the primary excitation can be powerful enough to excite\nother elements in the sample, resulting in enhanced X-ray production and\nthe need of proper corrections. For a new phase to become observable\nexperimentally, it must nucleate and grow to reach the resolution limit\nof analytical tools. It is thus not uncommon that some known equilibrium\nphases are not found, and some non-equilibrium phases form. One way to\ncircumvent this issue is to use incremental diffusion couples with\nnarrow concentrations next to the phase of interest so that only this\nphase may be formed.\n\nFor ternary and higher-order systems, a more efficient approach can be\nused by placing a thin layer of the third alloy between two alloys. The\nthin central layer is eventually consumed, and the diffusion path is not\nfixed as in the semi-infinite diffusion couples. The phase compositions\nchange continuously with time as a result of the overlapping of two\nquasi-equilibrated diffusion zones.\n\nA diffusion multiple contains three or more pure elements or alloys of\ndifferent compositions and is a sample with multiple diffusion couples\nand diffusion triples in it. It is more efficient in terms of both\nmaterials and time in comparison with equilibrated alloys and diffusion\ncouples. All alloy blocks are prepared individually and sealed in vacuum\nin a cylinder which is also used as one alloy for the diffusion\nmultiple. The sealed cylinder with vacuum inside also serves as the can\nfor subsequent hot isostatic pressing to achieve intimate interfacial\ncontacts. The cylinder can then be cut into disks for further annealing\ntreatments. A broad range of design strategies is needed for complex\ndiffusion multiples along with automated plotting procedures due to the\nlarge amounts of EMPA data. The major source of error lies in the\nextraction of tie-lines from EPMA results due to very condensed\ninformation in a small area and the deviation of scanned lines from\nthose perpendicular to the interface.\n\nIn terms of local equilibrium characteristics of diffusion\ncouples/multiples, it is evident that in the equilibrated materials\napproach, it may not be necessary to reach the full equilibrium for the\nwhole sample if one is only interested in the local equilibrium\ncompositions between two neighboring phases, which can even provide\ninformation on metastable extensions of two phases if the two phases are\nin a metastable equilibrium at the annealing temperature.\n",

      "source": "### Additional methods\n\nElectrical resistivities of different phases are usually different. A\nchange of slope of electric resistivity as a function of composition or\ntemperature or pressure reflects a phase transformation. This technique\nis simple and reliable.\n\nMagnetic transitions can be measured using a vibrating sample or\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer by\ndetermining the magnetic moment of a sample in presence of an applied\nmagnetic field. Magnetic field lines form closed loops, resulting in an\nexternal dipolar and demagnetizing field in a finite-sized sample. The\neffective field sensed by the sample is thus the difference between the\napplied field and the demagnetizing field. The magnetic transition\ntemperature is evaluated from the Arrott plots where the ratio of\nmagnetic field over magnetization with a proper exponent is plotted with\nrespect to the magnetization with another proper exponent for a series\nof temperatures. Those proper exponents result in parallel isotherm\nlines, and the isotherm line intersecting the origin corresponds to the\nmagnetic transition temperature.\n\nThin films with composition gradients, commonly referred to as\ncombinatorial libraries, can be used to study the phase relations\nsimilar to diffusion couples/multiples though the results may differ due\nto the effects of surface and potential interactions with the substrate.\n\nPhase relations at high pressures are measured in equipment using\ndiamond anvil cells (DAC) or multi-anvil devices. The high pressure is\nrealized by decreasing the area, i.e. the anvil culet size. Pressures up\nto 100 GPa can be created in DAC with a culet size of 0.3mm for small\nsamples in the order of 0.2 to 0.4mm. For large samples, the\nlarge-volume presses (LVP) technique is developed, typically using WC\nwith the pressure mostly limited to 30 GPa and the sample size ranging\nfrom 1mm<sup>3</sup> to 1cm<sup>3</sup>. The pressure can be measured by\neither the ruby (Cr<sup>3+</sup> doped Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)\nfluorescence line shift or the molar volume of a pressure marker by\nX-ray diffraction. The samples in DAC apparatus are heated by laser or\nresistive wire or a small heater around the samples, while high\ntemperatures in LVPs are achieved by resistive heaters. Crystal\nstructures are detected by in-situ X-ray or synchrotron diffraction.\nAttentions need to be paid to temperature and pressure homogeneity and\nthe non-hydrostatic stresses, which are both better controlled in LVP\nequipment.\n",

For thermochemical\nproperties as the main topic of the book, calorimetric, electrochemical,\nand vapor pressure methods are the primary techniques used with the\nfirst for accurate measurement of enthalpy and entropy, and the latter\ntwo for direct determination of Gibbs energy and activity. The\nelectrochemical method is discussed in Chapter . The calorimetric method\nis divided into solution, combustion, direct reaction, and heat capacity\ncalorimetry, respectively, which all involve chemical reactions to be\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter . The vapor pressure method involves the\nequilibrium of volatile species between gas and samples and is divided\ninto Knudsen effusion and equilibration methods, respectively.\n",

      "source": "### Solution calorimetry\n\nThe book edited by Marsh and O\u2019Hare \\[12\\] documented the detailed\nexperimental techniques used for solution calorimetry. In one\nexperiment, the enthalpy of solution of a single phase is measured in a\nparticular solvent. To convert this enthalpy of solution into enthalpy\nof formation of the phase, a thermodynamic cycle is setup for a chemical\nreaction to form this phase from either constitutive pure elements or\ncompounds. Therefore in another experiment, the enthalpy of solution of\nconstitutive pure elements or compounds is measured in the solvent as\nidentical as possible to that used in the first experiment. The\ndifference of the two enthalpies of solution thus gives the enthalpy of\nformation of the single phase from its constitutive elements or\ncompounds at the temperature of the samples before they are dropped into\nthe solvent, usually at room temperature.\n\nThe solvent can be aqueous solutions at ambient temperatures and\npressures or metallic/salt/oxide melts at high temperatures under either\nadiabatic or isoperibol conditions. The adiabatic calorimetry measures\nthe temperature change of the solvent and is usually more accurate than\nthe isoperibol calorimetry that measures the heat generated during the\ndissolution, though the adiabatic ones are with more complex\ninstruments. It is important that the choices of solvent and temperature\nensure the complete dissolution of all substances into the solvent to\nform a homogeneous solution. Furthermore, the effect of dilution and of\nchanges in solvent composition needs to be considered in the calculation\nof enthalpy of solution.\n\nA large number of solvents are used. For aqueous solvent, hydrofluoric\nacid or mixtures of HF and HCl are often used. For oxides, buffer-type\nsystems are typical such as lead and alkali borates and alkali\ntungstates/molybdates. For metallic phases, low melting metals such as\nSn, Bi, In, Pb, and Cd, sometimes Al and Cu, are used. Factors such as\nsolubility, dissolution kinetics, thermal history, stirring, heat flow,\nparticle size, and system size are to be optimized for accurate\nmeasurements. To enhance solution kinetics, the compound to be studied\ncan be mixed with another element or compound so that the mixture can\nform liquid in the solvent at higher reaction rate. In any case, it is\nimportant to calibrate the system with pure elements and compounds of\nknown enthalpy of formation.\n",

      "source": "### Combustion, direct reaction, and heat capacity calorimetry\n\nIn combustion calorimetry, the sample is ignited and reacts with\nreactive gases like oxygen or fluorine. To accurately calculate the\nenthalpy of formation from the enthalpy of combustion, the reliable\ncharacterization of reactants and reaction products is critical, such as\nincomplete combustion, impurities in the reactants which are often\nill-defined, and more than one reaction gaseous species and condensed\nphases. Combustion calorimeters are usually of isoperibol type around\nroom temperature in a water bath.\n\nThe direct reaction calorimetry is similar to the combustion calorimetry\nthough at high temperatures in heat-flux or adiabatic environments. The\npartial enthalpy of reaction can also be measured if the partial\npressure of volatile species can be controlled and measured. The key\nfactor for accurate results is that both the reactants and reaction\nproducts are well characterized and the reaction goes to completion\nquickly like in the combustion calorimetry. For reactive reactants,\nspecial procedure is needed to avoid their loss before the reaction\ntakes place.\n\nHeat capacity is defined as the amount of heat needed to increase the\ntemperature by 1K as shown by , and its integration with respect to\ntemperature from 0K gives entropy as shown by . At low temperatures,\nadiabatic calorimetry gives more accurate data of heat capacity though\nit is time consuming and requires complex instruments. At high\ntemperatures, the efficient and less accurate DSC method is more widely\nused.\n",

      "source": "### Vapor pressure method\n\nIn the Knudsen effusion method, a small amount of volatile species in\nthe gas phase effuses through a small orifice of 0.1 to 1 mm with\nnegligible influence of the equilibrium in the Knudsen cell. The vapor\nis ionized and analyzed with a mass spectrometer. The partial pressure\nof a species can be calculated from its ionization area and intensity\nthrough a calibration factor determined by a reference material with\nknown partial pressure. For high temperature measurements, care must be\ntaken to avoid the reactions between cell and sample and fragmentation\nof gas species on ionization. The typical vapor pressure range is\nbetween 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10 Pa.\n\nIn various equilibration methods, the total vapor pressure is usually\nmeasured directly using pressure gauges in the range of 10<sup>-7</sup>\nand 100 kPa. Other direct or indirect methods include\n\nthermogravimetric method for measuring the vapor mass\n\natomic absorption spectroscopy for gas composition\n\nmeasurement of sample composition equilibrated with a gas of\nwell-defined activity of the volatile species\n\nthe dew point method in which the condensation temperature of the\nvolatile component is measured from the vapor equilibrated with the\nsample at a higher temperature,\n\nthe chemical transport method to be discussed in Chapter .\n\nThe main error in all these methods is often due to inadequate\nequilibration between vapor and sample.\n",

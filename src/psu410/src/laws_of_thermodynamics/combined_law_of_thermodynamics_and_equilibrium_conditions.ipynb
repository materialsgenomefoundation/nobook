      "source": "## Combined law of thermodynamics and equilibrium conditions\n\nFor a system with an irreversible internal process taking place, the\nentropy change in the system thus consists of three parts: the heat\nexchange with the surrounding defined by , the entropy production due to\nthe internal process represented by , and the entropy of mass exchange\nwith the surrounding. The total entropy change of the system can thus be\nwritten as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $dS = \\frac{dQ}{T} + d_{ip}S + \\sum_{}^{}{S_{i}dN_{i}}$\n\nwhere $S_{i}$ is the unit entropy of component *i* in the surroundings,\noften called partial entropy of component *i*, and will be further\ndiscussed in Chapter\n\nCombining and and re-arranging, one obtains\n\nEq. \u2011 $dQ = TdS - Dd\\xi - \\sum_{}^{}{TS_{i}dN_{i}}$\n\nInserting and into yields the combined law of thermodynamics from the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics,\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = TdS - PdV + \\sum_{}^{}\\left( H_{i} - TS_{i} \\right){dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi$\n\nThe internal energy of the system is thus a function of *S*, *V*,\n*N<sub>i</sub>* and *\u03be* of the system, which are called natural\nvariables of the internal energy, i.e. *U*(*S*,*V*,*N<sub>i</sub>*,*\u03be*).\nThe other variables are dependent variables and can be represented by\npartial derivatives of the internal energy with respect to their\nrespective natural variables with other natural variables kept constant\nas shown below\n\nEq. \u2011\n$T = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S} \\right)_{V,\\ N_{i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$- P = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V} \\right)_{S,\\ N_{i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} = H_{i} - TS_{i} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{S,\\ V,N_{j \\neq i},\\ \\xi} = U_{i}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$- D = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial\\xi} \\right)_{S,\\ V,N_{i}\\ }$\n\nIn , a new variable, $\\mu_{i}$, is introduced. It is called chemical\npotential and defined as the internal energy change with respect of the\naddition of the component *i* when the entropy, volume and the amount of\nother components of the system are kept constant. It may be worth\npointing out that for a system at equilibrium, i.e. $d_{ip}S = 0$, and\nwith constant entropy, $dS = 0$, if it exchanges mass with the\nsurroundings, $dN_{i} \\neq 0$, the system must also exchange heat with\nthe surroundings at the same time in order to keep the entropy invariant\nas demonstrated by .\n\nThe pairs of the natural variables and their corresponding partial\nderivatives are called conjugate variables, i.e. *S* and *T*, *V* and\n*\u2013P*, *N<sub>i</sub>* and $\\mu_{i}$, and *\u03be* and *\u2013D*. There are minus\nsign in front of *P* and *D* as the increase of volume and the progress\nof the internal process decrease the internal energy of the system. The\nimportance of this conjugate relation will be evident when various forms\nof combined thermodynamic laws and various types of phase diagrams are\nintroduced in the book.\n\nThe last pair of conjugate variables, *\u03be* and *\u2013D*, is worthy of further\ndiscussion. Based on the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. , no\ninternal processes take place spontaneously if there is no entropy\nproductions, i.e. D\u22640 or *d\u03be*=0 and *D*\\>0. With D\u22640, there is no\ndriving for any internal processes, and the system is at a full\nequilibrium state. The last term in drops off, and *\u03be* becomes a\ndependent variable of the system and can be calculated from the\nequilibrium conditions. With *d\u03be*=0 and *D*\\>0, the system is under a\nconstrained equilibrium or freezing-in condition when the internal\nprocess is constrained not to take place, and *\u03be* remains to be an\nindependent variable of the system.\n\nThese two cases represent the two branches of thermodynamics:\nequilibrium, reversible thermodynamics and irreversible thermodynamics.\nIt is clear from the above discussions that these two branches are\nidentical if the internal energy is not only a function of *S*, *V*, and\n*N<sub>i</sub>* , but also any internal process variable *\u03be*. This means\nthat one should be able to evaluate the internal energy of a system for\nany freezing-in equilibrium conditions in addition to the full\nequilibrium condition. In the rest of the book, the freezing-in\nequilibrium and full equilibrium are not differentiated unless\nspecified.\n\nAs the mechanical work under hydrostatic pressure is very important in\nexperiments, let us define a new quantity called enthalpy as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $H = U + PV$\n\nIts differential form can be obtained from as\n\nEq. \u2011 $dH = dU + d(PV) = dQ + VdP + \\sum_{}^{}H_{i}{dN}_{i}$\n\nThere are two significant consequences of the above equation. First, for\na close system under constant pressure, i.e. ${dN}_{i} = dP = 0$, one\nhas $dH = dQ$. This implies that the enthalpy change in a system is\nequal to the heat exchange between the system and the surrounding of the\nsystem, which is why enthalpy and heat are often exchangeable in the\nliterature. Second, for an adiabatic system under constant pressure,\ni.e. $dQ = dP = 0$, can be re-arranged to the following equation\n\nEq. \u2011\n$H_{i} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{N_{j \\neq i,\\ \\ dQ = dP = 0}}$\n\n$H_{i}$ is thus the partial enthalpy of component *i* and will be\nfurther discussed in Chapter . The chemical potential of component *i*\ndefined in is thus related to the partial enthalpy and partial entropy\nof the component.\n\nTo further define equilibrium conditions of a system, consider a\nhomogeneous system in a state of internal equilibrium, i.e. no\nspontaneous internal processes are possible with $Dd\\xi = 0$, and\nbecomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = TdS - PdV + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} = \\sum_{}^{}{Y_{i}dX_{i}}$\n\nwhere *X* represents *S*, *V*, *N<sub>i</sub>*, and *Y* their conjugate\nvariables *T*, *-P*, $\\mu_{i}$. The state of the system with *c*\nindependent components is completely determined by the *c+2* variables,\ni.e. *S*, *V*, and *N<sub>i</sub>* with *i* from 1 to *c*.\n\nTo simplify the situation, let us limit the discussion to an isolated\nequilibrium system, i.e. $dU = 0$, and conduct a virtual internal\nexperiment inside the system by moving an infinitesimal amount of\n$X_{i}$, ${dX}_{i}$, with other $X_{j}$ kept constant, from one region\nof the system to another region of the system as schematically shown in\n.\n\nFigure \u2011: Virtual experiment for a system at equilibrium\n\nAs the system is homogeneous and at equilibrium,\n$- dX_{i}^{'} = dX_{i}^{\"} = dX_{i}$. The total change of the internal\nenergy of this internal process is the combination of the changes in the\ntwo regions, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = dU^{'} + dU^{\"} = Y_{i}^{'}dX_{i}^{'} + Y_{i}^{\"}dX_{i}^{\"} = \\left( - Y_{i}^{'} + Y_{i}^{\"} \\right)dX_{i} = 0$\n\nTherefore, $Y_{i}^{'} = Y_{i}^{\"}$ for *T*, *-P*, and $\\mu_{i}$,\nindicating that *T*, *-P*, and $\\mu_{i}$ are homogeneous in the system,\nrespectively, and are thus named as potentials of the system.\nFurthermore these potentials are independent of the size of the system\nand are often referred to as intensive variables in the literature. On\nthe other hand, all *X:s*, i.e. *S*, *V*, and *N<sub>i</sub>*, are\nproportional to the size of the system and may be normalized with\nrespect to the size of the system, usually in terms of total moles,\n\nEq. \u2011 $N = \\sum_{}^{}N_{i}$\n\nThey are thus called molar quantities and often referred to as extensive\nvariables, and the respective normalized variables are molar entropy,\nmolar volume, and mole fractions, defined as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $S_{m} = \\frac{S}{N}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $V_{m} = \\frac{V}{N}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $x_{i} = \\frac{N_{i}}{N}$\n\nConsider a small subsystem in this homogeneous system at equilibrium and\nlet the subsystem grow in size. The entropy, volume, and mass enclosed\nin the subsystem increase as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 ${dS = S}_{m}dN$\n\nEq. \u2011 $dV = V_{m}dN$\n\nEq. \u2011 $dN_{i} = x_{i}dN$\n\nThe corresponding change in the internal energy of the subsystem becomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = TdS - PdV + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} = \\left( TS_{m} - PV_{m} + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}x_{i} \\right)dN = U_{m}dN$\n\nBy integration one obtains the integral form of the internal energy as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$U = TS - PV + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}N_{i} = \\left( TS_{m} - PV_{m} + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}x_{i} \\right)N = U_{m}N$\n\nSimilarly, the molar enthalpy can be defined as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$H = U + PV = U_{m}N + PV_{m}N = \\left( U_{m} + PV_{m} \\right)N = H_{m}N$\n\nIn case a potential is not homogeneous in a system, the system will not\nbe in a state of equilibrium. Let us consider the same virtual\nexperiment as shown in for an isolated system that is not in\nequilibrium, i.e. by moving an infinitesimal amount of $X_{i}$,\n${dX}_{i}$, with other $X_{j}$ kept constant, from one region of the\nsystem to another region of the system with the two regions having\ndifferent potentials. The total internal energy change equals to zero as\nthe virtual experiment has $dU = 0$. Similarly, each region can be\nconsidered to be homogeneous by itself, and one has\n$- dX_{i}^{'} = dX_{i}^{\"} = dX_{i}$. The total internal energy change\nin the system is thus the sum of these two regions plus the entropy\nproduction due to the internal process with $d\\xi = dX_{i}$, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = dU^{'} + dU^{\"} + Dd\\xi = Y_{i}^{'}dX_{i}^{'} + Y_{i}^{\"}dX_{i}^{\"} + Dd\\xi = \\left( - Y_{i}^{'} + Y_{i}^{\"} \\right)dX_{i} + Dd\\xi = 0$\n\nConsequently, one obtains the following\n\n*Eq. 1\u201131* $D = Y_{i}^{'} - Y_{i}^{\"}$\n\nThe driving force thus represents the difference of the potential at the\ntwo regions, and the internal process is to eliminate inhomogeneity of\nthe potential with the heat transfer from high temperature regions to\nlow temperature regions, volume shrink of low pressure regions (high\n$\u2013P$) and volume expansion of high pressure regions (low $\u2013P$), and\ntransport of components from high chemical potential regions to low\nchemical potential regions.\n",

The first law\nof thermodynamics states that the exchanges of heat, work, and\nindividual components with its surroundings must obey the law of\nconversation of energy. In the domain of materials science and\nengineering, the energy of interest is at the atomic and molecular\nlevels. The energy at the higher and lower levels such as nuclear energy\nand kinetic and potential energies of a rigid body are usually excluded\nfrom the discussion of thermodynamics of materials.\n\nLet us consider a system receiving an amount of heat, *dQ*, and an\namount of work, *dW*, and an amount of each independent component *i*,\n*dN<sub>i</sub>*, from the surroundings. Such a system is called an open\nsystem in contrast to a closed system when *dN<sub>i</sub>*=0 for all\ncomponents, i.e. no exchange of mass between the system and the\nsurrounding. Other types of systems commonly defined in thermodynamics\ninclude adiabatic systems without exchange of heat, i.e. *dQ*=0, and\nisolated systems without exchange of any, i.e. *dQ*= *dW*=\n*dN<sub>i</sub>*=0.\n\nThe corresponding change of energy in the system, i.e. the internal\nenergy change, *dU*, is formulated in terms of the first law of\nthermodynamics as follows,\n\nEq. \u2011 $dU = dQ + dW + \\sum_{}^{}{H_{i}dN_{i}}$\n\nwhere $H_{i}$ is the unit energy of component *i* in the surroundings,\nand the summation is for all components in the system, which can be\ncontrolled independently from the surroundings, i.e. the independent\ncomponents of the system.\n\nIt is self-evident that the left-hand side of refers to the change\ninside the system, while its right-hand side is for the contributions\nfrom the surroundings to the system. In principle, no matter how the\nheat and mass are added, or how the work is done to the system, as far\nas their summation is the same, the change of the internal energy will\nbe the same based on the first law of thermodynamics, indicating that\nthe system reaches the same state for a closed system. The internal\nenergy is thus a state function in a close system as it does not depend\non how the state is reached.\n\nOn the other hand, for the purpose of easy mathematical treatment, a\nreversible process can be considered for a closed system, in which the\ninitial state of the system can be restored reversibly without any\nchanges left to the surroundings. Therefore, the heat transferred and\nthe work done to the system are identical to the heat and work lost by\nthe surroundings and vice versa. The classic example of reversible\nprocesses is the Carnot\u2019s cycle, which is shown in . It consists of four\nreversible processes for a closed system. The four reversible processes\nare compression at constant temperature *T<sub>1</sub>* (isothermal,),\ncompression without heat exchange (adiabatic) ending at *T<sub>2</sub>*,\nisothermal expansion at *T<sub>2</sub>*, and adiabatic expansion ending\nat *T<sub>1</sub>*.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematics of the Carnot\u2019s cycle\n\nThe Carnot\u2019s cycle involves a simple type of mechanical work, either\nhydrostatic expansion or compression, with the work that the surrounding\ndoes to the system represented by\n\nEq. \u2011 $dW = - PdV$\n\nwith *P* being the external pressure that the surrounding exerts on the\nsystem and *V* the volume of the system. It is now necessary to\ndifferentiate the external and internal variables for further discussion\nwith the former representing variables in the surroundings and the\nlatter representing variables in the system. For the isothermal\nprocesses in the Carnot\u2019s cycle, the entropy change of the system, *dS*,\ncan be defined as the heat exchange divided by temperature\n\nEq. \u2011 $dS = \\frac{dQ}{T}$\n\nIn addition to processes involving heat, work, and mass exchanges\nbetween the system and the surroundings, there could be internal\nprocesses taking place inside the system. As the system cannot do work\nto itself, the criterion for whether an internal process can occur\nspontaneously must be related to the heat exchange, which is related to\nthe entropy change as shown by .\n\nIt is a known fact that heat can spontaneously transfer from a higher\ntemperature (*T<sub>2</sub>*) region to a lower temperature\n(*T<sub>1</sub>*) region inside a system if the heat conduction is\nallowed, and this process is irreversible because heat cannot be\nconducted from a low temperature region to a high temperature region by\nitself. indicates that for the same amount of heat change, the entropy\nchange at *T<sub>1</sub>* is higher than that at *T<sub>2</sub>*, and\nthe heat conduction thus results in a positive entropy change in the\nsystem, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}S = - \\frac{dQ}{T_{2}} + \\frac{dQ}{T_{1}} = \\frac{dQ}{{T_{2}T}_{1}}\\left( {T_{2} - T}_{1} \\right) > 0$\n\nConsequently, the second law of thermodynamics is obtained, which states\nthat for an internal process to take place spontaneously or\nirreversibly, this internal process (*ip*) must have a positive entropy\nproduction, which can be written in a differential form as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $d_{ip}S > 0$\n\nFrom the definition of entropy change shown by , the amount of heat\nproduced by this irreversible internal process can be calculated as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011 $d_{ip}Q = Td_{ip}S$\n\nLet us represent this internal process by *d\u03be* and define the driving\nforce for this internal process by *D*. The work done by this internal\nprocess is thus *Dd\u03be*, which is released as heat, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $Dd\\xi = d_{ip}Q = Td_{ip}S$\n\nAn irreversible process thus must have a positive driving force in order\nfor it to take place spontaneously.\n",

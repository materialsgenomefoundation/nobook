      "source": "### Tie-lines and lever rule\n\nIt is self-evident from to Eq. 2\u20114 that while potentials are homogeneous\nin all phases in a heterogeneous system at equilibrium, the molar\nquantities usually have different values in individual phases. This is\nalso stipulated in various Clausius-Clapeyron equations such as to and\nto . The difference in molar quantities thus increases the\ndimensionality of the phase region by the number of potentials replaced\nby their conjugate molar quantities. The maximum dimensionality of a\nphase region is the dimensionality of the phase diagram under\nconsideration. This thus creates a finite space between phases in\nequilibrium in the phase diagram with some axes being molar quantities.\n\nFor an equilibrium system under constant $T$, $P$ and $N_{i}$, the\npotentials in the system and their conjugate molar quantities in each\nphase are all uniquely defined. In a phase diagram with one or more\npotentials replaced by their conjugate molar quantities, two phases in\nequilibrium in a system with $c$ independent components are connected by\na $c$ dimensional line in a *c*+2 dimensional space or\nits$\\ $*c+1*-dimensional projection as discussed in Chapter . These\nlines are called tie-lines and collectively represent a two-phase\nequilibrium region. For a $k$-phase equilibrium, there are total\n$C_{k}^{2} = \\frac{k(k - 1)}{2}$ tie-lines connecting every two phases\nwith $k - 1\\ $of them independent because the number of independent\ntie-lines increases by one with each new phase added. For the invariant\nequilibrium with zero degree of freedom, the number of phases in\nequilibrium is $c + 2$ shown by containing\n$C_{c + 2}^{2} = \\frac{(c + 2)(c + 1)}{2}$ tie-lines with $c + 1$ of\nthem being independent.\n\nInside the space encapsulated by the tie-lines, the axis variables of\nthe phase diagram (a mixture of potentials and molar quantities) can be\nchanged independently without changing the phases in equilibrium and\ntheir properties. Only the relative amounts of individual phases are\nadjusted accordingly to maintain the conservation of the molar\nquantities in the system specified by the molar quantity axes of the\nphase diagram. The geometric feature circumscribing the space\nencapsulated by the tie-lines no longer represents any phase regions,\nbut a boundary between the neighbouring phase regions. Its\ncharacteristics will be discussed in more details in the next few\nsections. As properties in each phase are homogeneous, the values of\nmolar quantities of a system are simply the sum of individual phases and\ncan be represented by the following equation\n\nEq. \u2011 $A_{m} = \\sum_{\\alpha}^{}{f^{\\alpha}A_{m}^{\\alpha}}$\n\nwhere $A_{m}$ and $A_{m}^{\\alpha}$ represent the values of a molar\nquantity of the system and the $\\alpha$ phase, respectively,\n$f^{\\alpha}$ the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase, and the summation\ngoes over all phases in equilibrium with each other. With\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^{}f^{\\alpha} = 1$, can be re-arranged into the following\nequation\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^{}{f^{\\alpha}\\left( {A_{m} - A}_{m}^{\\alpha} \\right)} = 0$\n\nis commonly referred as lever rule. For a two-phase equilibrium of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, it becomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{A_{m}^{\\beta} - A_{m}}{A_{m}^{\\beta} - A_{m}^{\\alpha}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$f^{\\beta} = \\frac{A_{m}^{\\alpha} - A_{m}}{A_{m}^{\\alpha} - A_{m}^{\\beta}}$\n\nFor a phase diagram with the number of axes being\n$n = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$, the number of possible axes being\nmolar quantities is thus $k \\leq n$.

      "source": "### Phase diagrams with both potentials and molar quantities\n\nBased on Gibbs phase rule discussed in Chapters and , the\ndimensionalities of phase regions in a potential phase diagram are given\nby or . With every potential substituted by its conjugate molar\nquantity, the dimensionalities of phase regions increase by one until\nthe phase region reaches the dimensionality of the phase diagram. The\naxes of this phase diagram now consist of both potentials and molar\nquantities. The dimensionality of a phase region can thus be represented\nby the following equation based on\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 - p + n_{m} \\leq \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$\n\nwhere $n_{m}$ is the number of molar axes. This equation is applicable\nto phase regions with more than $n_{m} + 1$ phases. For phase regions\nwith $n_{m} + 1$ phases or fewer, the dimensionalities are the same as\nthe phase diagram, i.e. $\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$,\nand no longer vary with the number of molar quantity axes. When all\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ potentials are substituted by their\nconjugate molar quantities, one obtains a complete molar phase diagrams\nto be discussed in Chapter , and all phase regions have the\nsame-dimensionality of $\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$.\n\nFor the sake of graphic visualization, let us exam a two-dimensional\nphase diagram of a one-component system. Topologically, it is equivalent\nto a multi-component system with $n_{s} = c - 1$. In , three\ntwo-dimensional phase diagrams are shown for pure Fe. In principle, one\ncan use any one of them to illustrate mixed potential and molar phase\ndiagrams. For the purpose of practical usefulness, one selects the\n$T - ( - P)$ potential diagram as temperature and pressure are the two\ntypical variables controlled in experiments of one-component systems.\nThe conjugate molar quantities of $- P$ and $T$ are molar volume and\nmolar entropy, respectively. For stable phases, any pair of conjugate\nvariables changes in the same direction as illustrated by and , i.e. the\nphase stable at higher $T$ has higher molar entropy, and the phase\nstable at higher $\u2013P$, i.e. lower pressure, has higher molar volume. Let\nus first substitute $\u2013P$ by $V_{m}$ as shown in a. The dimensionality of\na sing-phase region remains unchanged because of\n$p = 1 < 2 = n_{m} + 1$. The dimensionality of two-phase regions is\nchanged from 1 to 2 due to $\\upsilon_{m} = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2$ from .\n\nFigure \u2011: T-Vm and Sm-(-P) phase diagrams of Fe\n\nAs both phases in a two-phase equilibrium have the same temperature, all\ntie-lines, depicted by dotted lines, are perpendicular to the\ntemperature axis in a. When the molar volume of the system changes from\none end of a tie-line to another end at a constant temperature, the mole\nfraction of one phase increases from 0 to 1, and the mole fraction of\nanother phase decreases from 1 to 0. The tine-lines at various\ntemperatures combine together to form a two-dimensional two-phase\nregion. The two curves at the two ends of tie-lines represent the\nboundaries between the single-phase and two-phase regions and are no\nlonger phase regions themselves. They are thus called phase boundaries.\n\nBy the same token, by changing the temperature at a constant molar\nvolume of the system, the system will locate on different tie-lines with\nthe amounts of the two phases determined by the lever rule. It is thus\nclear that the system maintains the two-phase equilibrium state with\nboth $T$ and $V_{m}$ changing independently inside the two-dimensional\ntwo-phase region. This seems in contradiction to Gibbs phase rule being\n$\\upsilon = 3 - p = 1$ from , but it is not because Gibbs phase rule\napplies strictly to potential phase diagrams only, while the $T - V_{m}$\nphase diagram has one of its axis being a molar quantity. As an\nalternative, one may consider as a modified Gibbs phase rule in\ndescribing the dimensionality of a phase region in a mixed potential and\nmolar phase diagram with $p \\geq n_{m} + 1$.\n\nThe two three-phase equilibria in pure Fe are also represented by\ntie-lines connecting all three phases. The dimensionality of three-phase\nregions is $\\upsilon_{m} = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1$ from , and the three two-phase\ntie-lines for a three-phase equilibrium thus overlap each other with\ntheir three molar volumes on the same tie-line.\n\nLet us examine the two three-phase equilibria in more detail. In the\n\u03b3/\u03b1/\u03b5 three-phase equilibrium at $T_{E} = 756.6\\ K$ and\n$\\left( - P_{E} \\right) = - 1.046 \\bullet 10^{10}\\ Pa$, the molar\nvolumes of \u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03b5 are 6.837, 6.677, 6.582 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$,\nrespectively. There are two two-phase regions at higher temperatures and\none two-phase region at lower temperatures. This is also shown in the\npotential phase diagram of a with two two-phase curves entering into and\none two-phase curve leaving from the three-phase equilibrium point with\ndecreasing temperature. Considering the system with the fixed molar\nvolume equal to that of the $\\gamma$ phase, i.e.\n$V_{m}^{\\ }\\left( T_{E} \\right) = 6.677 \\bullet 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$. At\n$T > T_{E}$, the system is in the single \u03b3 phase region. With decrease\nin temperature across $T_{E}$, it enters into the $\\alpha + \\varepsilon$\ntwo-phase region. This transformation can be written as follows and is\ncalled a eutectoid reaction\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\varepsilon$\n\nThis type of transformations is named as eutectic reaction if the high\ntemperature phase is a liquid phase. If the system molar volume is\nbetween $V_{m}^{\\gamma}$ and $V_{m}^{\\alpha}$ at $756.6K$, with decrease\nof temperature, the system first moves from the single \u03b3 phase region to\nthe $\\alpha + \\gamma$ two-phase region when the\n$\\gamma/(\\alpha + \\gamma)$ phase boundary is crossed. When the\ntemperature reaches $T_{E}$, the eutectoid transformation takes place in\nthe remaining \u03b3 phase. The $\\alpha$ formed prior to the eutectoid\ntransformation is called proeutectoid $\\alpha$. By the same token, when\nthe system molar volume is between $V_{m}^{\\gamma}$ and\n$V_{m}^{\\varepsilon}$ at $756.6K$, proeutectoid $\\varepsilon$ would form\nfollowed by the eutectoid transformation with decrease in temperature.\n\nOn the other hand, the $L/\\delta/\\gamma$ three-phase equilibrium at\n$T_{P} = 1977.9\\ K$ and\n$\\left( - P_{P} \\right) = - 5.111 \\bullet \\ 10^{9}\\ Pa$ has different\ncharacteristics, where the subscript P will be defined shortly. There\nare one two-phase equilibrium above and two two-phase equilibria below\nthe invariant temperature, shown in the potential phase diagram of a\nwith one two-phase curve entering into and two two-phase curves leaving\nfrom the three-phase equilibrium point with decreasing temperature. The\nmolar volumes of $L$, $\\delta$, and $\\gamma$ at $T_{P}$ are 7.735,\n7.542, and 7.498 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$, respectively. For $T > T_{P}$,\nthe two-phase region is $L + \\gamma$. If the system molar volume is\nbetween 7.735 and 7.498 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$, i.e.\n$V_{m}^{L}\\left( T_{P} \\right)$ and\n$V_{m}^{\\gamma}\\left( T_{P} \\right)$, when the temperature reaches\n$T_{P}$, $L$ and $\\gamma$ are combined to form $\\delta$ with the\ntransformation written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\gamma \\rightarrow \\delta$\n\nThis type of reactions is called as peritectic reaction or peritectoid\nreaction when the liquid phase is replaced by a solid phase, denoted by\nthe subscript P. At $T < T_{P}$, one or both high temperature phases may\nno longer be present in equilibrium depending on the value of the system\nmolar volume. For\n$V_{m}^{\\ } = V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542 \\bullet 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$,\nthe peritectic reaction, , can come to completion with no $L$ and\n$\\gamma$ left upon decreasing temperature. For\n$V_{m}^{\\gamma}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.498 < V_{m}^{\\ } < V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542\\ \\left( 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol \\right)$,\nthe liquid phase is consumed, and the system enters the\n$\\gamma + \\delta$ two-phase region. On the other hand, for\n$V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542 < V_{m}^{\\ } < V_{m}^{\\ L}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.735\\ \\ \\left( 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol \\right)$,\nthe $\\gamma$ phase is consumed instead, and the system enters into the\n$L + \\delta$ two-phase equilibrium region upon cooling.\n\nLet us now replace $T$ by $S_{m}$ to obtain the $( - P) - S_{m}$ phase\ndiagram shown in b. The morphology of this phase diagram is identical to\nthe $T - V_{m}$ phase diagram just discussed with all tie-lines\nperpendicular to the pressure axis. The transformations at the two\nthree-phase equilibria with $( - P)$ decreasing or $P$ increasing are as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\varepsilon$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\delta \\rightarrow L + \\gamma$\n\nTo visualize two-dimensional phase diagrams of binary systems, one\nusually keeps the pressure constant. One type of commonly used binary\nphase diagram is the temperature-composition ($T - x$) phase diagram. As\nan example, let us re-plot the $T - \\mu_{C}$ potential diagram shown in\ninto a $T - x_{C}$ mixed potential and molar phase diagram by replacing\nthe chemical potential of $C$ by its mole fraction. The $T - x_{C}$\nphase diagram thus obtained is shown in . In this phase diagram there\nare one peritectic reaction and two eutectic reactions as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\delta \\rightarrow \\gamma$\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow \\gamma + C$\n\nEq. 3\u201161 $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\alpha + C$\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - x_{C}\\ $ phase diagram of the Fe-C binary system\n\nIn in Chapter , it was discussed the formation of miscibility gaps due\nto repulsive interactions between components. One example is shown in\nfor the Al-Zn binary system in terms of both $T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential\nphase diagram and $\\ T - x_{Zn}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase\ndiagram.\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential phase diagram (a) and\n$\\ T - x_{Zn}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase diagram (b) of the\nAl-Zn binary system\n\nIn ,there are one eutectic reaction and one eutectoid reaction as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow fcc + hcp$\n\nEq. \u2011 $fcc\\# 1 \\rightarrow fcc\\# 2 + hcp$\n\nThe eutectoid reaction, , is also termed as monotectoid reaction because\nthe fcc phase appears on both sides of the reaction with different\ncompositions, $fcc\\# 1$ and $fcc\\# 2$, due to the miscibility gap. The\nhighest temperature of the miscibility gap is called the consolute point\nas discussed in Chapter , which can be clearly seen in the\n$T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential phase diagram shown in . This is a critical\npoint, marking the limit of instability as shown in .\n\nWhen there is only one phase on either side of the reaction, i.e. both\nphases have the same composition, the reaction is called a congruent\nreaction. One example is shown in for the $T - x_{SiO_{2}}\\ $ mixed\npotential and molar phase diagram of the CaO-SiO<sub>2</sub>\npseudo-binary system with two congruent reactions as follows\n\nEq. 3\u201164 $L \\rightarrow CaSiO_{3}$\n\nEq. 3\u201165 $L \\rightarrow {Ca}_{2}SiO_{4}$\n\nThey are not invariant reactions based on the Gibbs phase rule. In , it\nis noted that there are one miscibility gap in the liquid phase close to\nthe $SiO_{2}$ side, four eutectic reactions with one being monotectic\ninvolving two liquid phases due to the miscibility gap, and three\nperitectic reactions.\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - x_{SiO_{2}}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase diagram of\nthe CaO-SiO<sub>2</sub> pseudo-binary system.\n\nLet us generalize the above discussion to phase diagrams with\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ axes. In such a phase diagram, the\nmaximum number of phases is given by as\n$p_{\\max} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2$. The number of phases on the\neither side of an invariant reaction can vary from one phase to\n$p_{\\max} - 1 = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ phases with the remaining\nphases on the other side of the reaction, typically with the potential\ndecreasing from left to right. The invariant reaction with one phase on\nthe left of the reaction is named as eutectic, or eutectoid reaction\ndepending on if the phase on the left of the reaction is liquid or\nsolid. The rest invariant reactions are named as peritectic or\nperitectoid reactions with or without a liquid phase.\n",

For regions with the number of phases\n$p \\leq n_{m} + 1 = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 = p_{\\max}$ (see ), the\nphase regions have the same-dimensionality as that of the phase diagram,\ni.e. all phase regions have the same-dimensionality of\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$, and any geometric feature with\nlower-dimensionalities, i.e. from 0 to $\\ \\left( c - n_{s} \\right)$, is\nnot phase regions, but phase boundaries between neighbouring phase\nregions. For the sake of graphic visualization, the molar phase diagram\nof pure Fe is shown in obtained by combining the two mixed phase\ndiagrams in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Molar phase diagram of Fe\n\nIn this molar phase diagram, all one-, two-, and three-phase regions are\ntwo-dimensional, the same as the dimensionality of the phase diagram. A\ntwo-phase region is made up by tie-lines connecting the two phases in\nequilibrium, while a three phase-region is surrounded by three two-phase\ntie-lines, i.e. a tie-triangle. The amount of each phase in the\ntie-triangle can be obtained using the lever rule represented by and .\nAs can be seen, phase boundaries between a one-phase region and a\ntwo-phase region are one-dimensional. When the system crosses such a\nphase boundary, the number of phases changes by one from two to one or\nvice versa. Phase boundaries between two- and three-phase regions are\nrepresented by two-phase tie-lines. When the system crosses such a phase\nboundary, the number of phases also changes by one. The\nlowest-dimensional phase boundaries are the points between one- and\nthree-phase regions that are zero-dimensional and the intercept of four\none-dimensional phase boundaries. When the system crosses such a phase\nboundary, the number of phases changes by two.\n\nFor multi-component systems, the phase relations cannot be directly\nvisualized. By representing the system equations in terms of equilibrium\nconditions and level rules on a phase boundary using phases separately\nfrom the two adjacent phase regions, Palatnik and Landau \\[4\\]\npostulated that the difference between the number of unknowns and\nequations gives the dimensionality of the phase boundary and derived the\nfollowing relationships\n\nEq. \u2011 $D^{+} + D^{-} = r - b = c - n_{s} - b$\n\nwhere $D^{+}$ and $D^{-}$ are the numbers of phases added and removed\nwhen the phase boundary is crossed, and $r$ and $b$ are the\ndimensionalities of the phase diagram and the phase boundary,\nrespectively. They termed the as the contact rule, which is named as the\nMPL boundary rule by Hillert \\[1\\].\n\nBy the same token, is applicable to any phase boundary where the two\nadjacent phase regions have the same-dimensionality of the phase\ndiagram, even in phase diagrams with a mixture of potentials and molar\nquantities as the diagram axes. This can be understood because the\npotentials are homogeneous in all phases in equilibrium on the phase\nboundary. The phase boundary is thus equivalent to those in a complete\nmolar phase diagram with its number of components equal to the number of\nmolar axes in a mixed potential and molar phase diagrams minus one, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $c^{'} = n_{m} - 1 = c - n_{s}$\n\nThe last part of stems from the discussion related to when all\n$c^{'} + 1$ potentials are replaced by their conjugate molar quantities,\nwhich is analogous to a molar phase diagram with $\\ c$ independent\ncomponents and $n_{s}$ potentials fixed.\n\nFor a two-dimensional phase diagram with $r = 2$, the phase boundary can\nbe either zero- or one--dimensional. As shown in , the basic element of\na molar phase diagram is a joint of four one-dimensional phase boundary\nlines. When a phase boundary line is crossed, the number of phases is\neither increased or decreased by one. The joint of four one-dimensional\nphase boundary lines is zero-dimensional. The number of phases differs\nby two between the phase regions across the zero-dimensional joint. Two\nscenarios are possible\n\nTwo phases are added or removed, i.e. $D^{+} = 2$ and $D^{-} = 0$ or\n$D^{+} = 0$ and $D^{-} = 2$, and the number of phases in the two phase\nregions differs by two;\n\nOne phase is added, one phase is removed, i.e. $D^{+} = D^{-} = 1$, and\nthe phase regions have the same number of phases.\n\nBy combining the contact rules for both zero- and one-dimensional phase\nboundaries, it is evident that the above two scenarios co-exist in a\njoint of four-phase regions with two-phase regions following the first\nscenario and other two-phase regions following the second scenario.\nBased on the Schreinemakers\u2019 rule generalized by Hillert \\[5\\], each of\nthe two-phase regions with the same number of phases contains one\nextrapolation of the phase boundaries, while the other two-phase regions\ncontain either zero or two extrapolations of the phase boundaries.

However, there is one type of\nwidely used projection in the literature, i.e. the liquidus surface in\nternary systems under constant pressure with temperature and mole\nfractions of two components as its axes. The projection along the\ntemperature axis reveals the composition regions for primary phases that\nsolidify from liquid upon cooling. These regions are separated by\nunivariant lines of three-phase equilibria. The projections along one of\nthe two mole fractions show the temperature as a function of composition\non the univariant three-phase equilibrium lines and also depict whether\na four-phase equilibrium is peritectic or eutectic. There are four\nscenarios for the three univariant three-phase equilibrium lines to meet\nat the four-phase equilibrium as depicted in and discussed individually\nbelow.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic four options for three univariant three-phase\nequilibrium lines to meet at the invariant four-phase equilibrium\n\nThe first scenario is that with decreasing temperature, all three\nunivariant lines merge into the four-phase equilibrium. It indicates\nthat the liquid phase does not exist at temperatures below the\nfour-phase invariant reaction. This invariant reaction is thus a ternary\neutectic reaction with liquid completely transformed to three solid\nphases upon cooling, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma$\n\nIn the second scenario, two univariant lines merge into and one leaves\nfrom the four-phase equilibrium with decreasing temperature. This means\nthat one solid phase at higher temperature is no longer stable at lower\ntemperature, and it must react with the liquid phase to form the\nremaining two solid phases. The four-phase invariant reaction is thus\nperitectic. The solid phase common to both univariant lines at high\ntemperatures reacts with the liquid phase. Assuming that this phase is\n$\\alpha$, the four-phase invariant reaction becomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta + \\gamma$\n\nIn the third scenario, one univariant line points to and two leave from\nthe four-phase equilibrium with decreasing temperature. A new phase\nforms at low temperatures from the three high temperature phases, e.g.\nliquid, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$, with the four-phase invariant reaction as\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\alpha + \\beta \\rightarrow \\gamma$\n\nThe fourth scenario is the inverse of the first scenario, indicating the\nformation of liquid from solid phases upon cooling, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma \\rightarrow L$\n\nThis case has not been observed in reality.\n\nAs an example, the liquidus projections of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system\nare shown in in two formats\\[6\\], i.e. (a) three-dimensional liquidus\nsurface with the isotherms showing the liquidus contours; (b)\nconventional projection to the composition axis with the temperature\ndecrease shown by arrows; (c) projection to the temperature and weight\nfraction of Si. The first to third scenarios of invariant reactions\ndiscussed above can clearly be identified and listed in . It is evident\nthat c provides the easiest route to visualize the type of invariant\nreactions as show by .\n\nFigure \u2011: Liquidus of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system\\[6\\], (a)\nthree-dimensional presentation of the liquidus; (b) projection to the\ncomposition triangle with isotherms (dotted lines) superimposed and\ntheir temperatures indicated close to the horizontal axis.\n\nTable \u2011: Invariant liquidus reactions of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system\nwith the composition of the liquid phase \\[6\\]\n\n| Reaction | T, \u00b0C | w<sub>Fe</sub>, % | w<sub>Si</sub>, % |\n|----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|          | 1178  | 77.9              | 21.0              |\n|          | 1155  | 49.0              | 0.16              |\n|          | 1127  | 52.7              | 2.81              |\n| -H-L     | 1076  | 41.6              | 44.0              |\n|          | 1073  | 51.0              | 7.19              |\n|          | 1050  | 53.8              | 18.4              |\n| -H-L     | 1019  | 34.8              | 44.4              |\n|          | 1004  | 49.0              | 12.6              |\n|          | 1000  | 46.7              | 13.2              |\n| -L       | 940   | 37.9              | 32.0              |\n|          | 921   | 33.7              | 20.1              |\n|          | 899   | 33.8              | 32.2              |\n|          | 884   | 30.8              | 26.0              |\n| -L       | 877   | 29.5              | 35.2              |\n|          | 851   | 23.3              | 21.6              |\n|          | 834   | 22.2              | 31.7              |\n|          | 825   | 22.1              | 25.7              |\n|          | 823   | 21.8              | 25.4              |\n|          | 715   | 6.64              | 10.8              |\n|          | 694   | 6.11              | 17.1              |\n|          | 680   | 4.68              | 11.6              |\n|          | 630   | 2.11              | 4.10              |\n|          | 616   | 1.76              | 6.56              |\n|          | 598   | 1.22              | 14.3              |\n|          | 575   | 0.73              | 12.7              |\n\nIn contrast to projections, sectioning is used more often to understand\nphase relations in multi-component systems. Sectioning of a potential\nphase diagrams is relatively simple as the resulted phase diagram\nbehaves like a system with one component less. The same is true if\npotentials are sectioned in phase diagrams with both potential and molar\nquantities as the section is along the tie-lines of the fixed\npotentials. As an example, shows the ternary Al-Fe-Si potential and\nmolar phase diagrams sectioned at T=1273K and P=1atm, commonly referred\nto as isothermal section. It is evident that the geometric features of\nboth phase diagrams are identical to those of pure Fe shown in and ,\nrespectively, with one-, two-, and three-phase regions and corresponding\nphase boundaries.\n\nFigure \u2011: Ternary isothermal section of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system at\nT=1273K and P=1atm\n\nOn the other hand, when the phase diagram is sectioned along a molar\nquantity, it would usually not follow a tie-line because phases in\nequilibrium usually have different values for the same molar quantity.\nConsequently, there are no tie-lines inside such phase diagrams in\ngeneral, and any phase regions only show which phases are in equilibrium\nwith each other without any information on the values of molar\nquantities of individual phases.\n\nThis type of sectioning reduces both the dimensionalities of the phase\ndiagram and phase boundary by the same number, but does not alter the\nnumber of phases in the adjacent phase regions. The contact rule, i.e. ,\nthus remains valid and is applicable to phase regions with the\nsame-dimensionality as that of the sectioned phase diagram. Similarly,\nthe Schreinemakers\u2019 rule shown in is valid under the same conditions.\n\nFor example, the two-dimensional phase diagram of the Mg-Al-Zn ternary\nsystem sectioned with one atmospheric pressure and the weight fraction\nof Zn fixed at 0.01 is shown in plotted with temperature and mole\nfraction of Al \\[7\\]. This phase diagram is commonly called isopleth and\nis generated by fixing one potential, the pressure, $P$, changing the\nchemical potentials of Al and Zn to their conjugate molar quantities\nrepresented by weight fractions of Al and Zn, and sectioning at\n$w_{Zn} = 0.01$. From the discussions in Chapter , the phase regions\nwith the number of phases equal to three or fewer, i.e.\n$p \\leq n_{m} + 1 = 3$, have the same-dimensionality as the phase\ndiagram, i.e. two-dimensional in the present case, and the phase\nboundary rule is applicable. The maximum number of phases co-existing at\nequilibrium is given by as following for the present case\n\nEq. \u2011 $p_{\\max} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 = 3 - 1 + 2 = 4$\n\nThis is because introducing molar quantities only increases the\ndimensionality of phase regions and does not change the maximum number\nof co-existing phases.\n\nThe dimensionality of a four-phase region is calculated from as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 - p + n_{m} - n_{ms} = 3 - 1 + 2 - 4 + 2 - 1 = 1$\n\nwhere $n_{ms}$ is the number of sectioned molar quantities. Since the\ndimensionality of a four-phase region is lower than that of the phase\ndiagram, the phase boundary rule cannot be applied directly. Such a\nfour-phase region, liquid+Mg+\u03b3+\u03c6, is shown in between three three-phase\nregions of liquid+Mg+\u03b3, liquid+Mg+\u03c6, and Mg+\u03b3+\u03c6.\n\nFigure \u2011: Isopleth with the weight fraction of Zn fixed at 0.01 of the\nMg-Al-Zn ternary system.\n\nalso displays information on what phases are in equilibrium for a given\nalloy at various temperatures. One example is shown by the dotted\nvertical line marking the weight fraction of Al being 0.09, a widely\nused Mg alloy called AZ91. Various phases are present at different\ntemperature ranges, but the equilibrium phase fractions and phase\ncompositions are not shown in the figure as the tie-lines are not in the\nplane of the phase diagram and have to be calculated at each temperature\nindividually. shows the amount of each phase of the AZ91 alloy as a\nfunction of temperature with the dotted lines depicting the values under\nthe equilibrium condition and the solid lines depicting the values under\nthe so-called Scheil condition assuming no diffusion in solid phases and\ninfinitelyfast diffusion in liquid. Similarly, the composition of each\nphase can also be plotted as shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Mole fraction of individual phases under equilibrium (dotted\ncurves) and Scheil (solid curves) conditions in the AZ91 alloy\n\nFigure \u2011: Mass fraction of Al and Zn in the Mg solid solution phase\nunder equilibrium (dotted curves) and Scheil (solid curves) conditions\nin AZ91\n",

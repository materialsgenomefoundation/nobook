Two\nscenarios may exist where the variations of properties can be either\ncontinuous or discontinuous. In the scenario of continuous variations,\nthe gradients of those variations must be coupled so that the system\nremains at equilibrium. The number of independent variables is thus\nreduced. These gradients must also be constrained along the boundaries\nbetween the system and the surroundings. This type of constrained\nequilibrium is not discussed in the book as it involves heterogeneous\nboundary conditions between the system and the surroundings and depends\non the morphology of the system.\n\nIn the second scenario with discontinuous variations, those properties\nhave different values in different portions of the system, but remain\nhomogenous within each portion. The system is in equilibrium as each\nportion is in equilibrium with all other portions of the system. Those\nhomogeneous portions represent different phases in the system with the\nproperties in each phase being homogeneous at equilibrium. In the\nprevious chapter, it has been shown that all potentials are homogeneous\nin a homogeneous system.\n\nFor a heterogeneous system, the same conclusion can be obtained. If the\ntemperature is inhomogeneous, heat can be conducted from high\ntemperature locations to low temperature locations, and this process is\nirreversible based on the second law of thermodynamics because it\nincreases the internal entropy of the system. If the pressure is\ninhomogeneous, the amounts of lower molar volume phases will increase to\nreduce the internal energy of the system. If the chemical potential of a\ncomponent is inhomogeneous, the chemical potential difference of the\ncomponent will drive that component to the locations with a lower\nchemical potential so the internal energy of the system can be\ndecreased. Therefore, it can be concluded that all potentials are\nhomogeneous in a heterogeneous system at equilibrium, and the variables\nthat are not homogeneous are thus their conjugate molar quantities.\nUnder certain special circumstances to be discussed in later part of\nthis book, some molar quantities may also have the same values in\ndifference phases.\n\nIn a system at equilibrium with $c$ independent components, there are\n$c + 2$ pairs of conjugate variables based on or though more can be\nadded as shown by depending on experimental conditions. For simplicity,\nmost discussions in this book are limited to systems with $c + 2$ pairs\nof conjugate variables unless otherwise specified, with number \u201c2\u201d\nrepresenting conjugate variables of $T - S$ and $( - P) - V$.\n\nFor a system under constant temperature, pressure, and moles of each\nindependent component, the equilibrium condition derives from as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dG = - SdT - Vd( - P) + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi = - Dd\\xi = 0$\n\nConsequently, the equilibrium state is defined by the minimization of\nGibbs energy of the system at constant $T$, $P$ and $N_{i}$ because the\nsecond derivatives need to be positive for the equilibrium system to be\nstable as stipulated by . For heterogeneous systems with two or more\nphases, Gibbs energy of the system is the weighted summation of Gibbs\nenergies of individual phases, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\frac{G}{N} = G_{m} = \\sum_{\\beta}^{}{f^{\\beta}G_{m}^{\\beta}}$\n\nwhere $f^{\\beta}$ and $G_{m}^{\\beta}$ are the mole fraction and molar\nGibbs energy of the phase $\\beta$, respectively, and the summation goes\nover all phases in the system. $f^{\\beta}$ is equal to zero for phases\nnot present in the equilibrium state.\n\nThe minimization of Gibbs energy of the system is carried out under the\nfollowing mass balance conditions\n\nEq. \u2011\n$x_{i} = \\sum_{\\beta}^{}{f^{\\beta}x_{i}^{\\beta}} = \\sum_{\\beta}^{}{f^{\\beta}\\frac{\\sum_{\\beta - t}^{}{a^{\\beta - t}\\sum_{k}^{}{i_{k}^{\\beta - t}y_{k}^{\\beta - t}}}}{\\sum_{\\beta - t}^{}{a^{\\beta - t}\\left( 1 - y_{va}^{\\beta - t} \\right)}}}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\sum_{i}^{}x_{i} = 1$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\sum_{k}^{}y_{k}^{\\beta - t} = 1$\n\nwhere $a^{\\beta - t}$ and $y_{k}^{\\beta - t}$ are the number of site in\nsublattice $t$ in the $\\beta$ phase and the corresponding site fraction\nof species $k$ in the sublattice, respectively, and $i_{k}^{\\beta - t}$\nis the stoichiometry of the component $i$ in the species $k$, as used in\n. The summation in runs over species for each sublattice. For phases\ncontaining ionic species, electroneutrality also needs to be maintained,\ni.e. is applied to each phase. This minimization problem of Gibbs energy\nunder the constraint of mass conservation can be solved by means of a\nrange of algorithms. It should be noted that the mole fractions of\nphases and site fractions of species are bounded between 0 and 1.\n\nThis minimization procedure must result in that potentials are\nhomogeneous in the system as discussed above. Since the present book\ndeals with thermodynamics of materials, the chemical potential of each\ncomponent is of particular interest and must be homogenous in all phases\nof the system at equilibrium, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i}^{\\alpha} = \\mu_{i}^{\\beta} = \\mu_{i}^{\\gamma}\\ldots\\ldots$\n\nFor phases in which the chemical potentials of individual components\ncannot be evaluated due to stoichiometry, the combined chemical\npotentials can be used to relate individual potentials as shown by and .\nAs proved in Chapter shown by , the chemical potential of a component in\na solution is represented by the intercept on the Gibbs energy axis by\nthe multi-dimensional tangent surface of Gibbs energy of the solution\nplotted with respect to mole fractions of independent components. The\nGibbs energy functions of all phases in equilibrium must thus share the\nsame tangent surface. This is usually referred to as the common tangent\nconstruction for phases at equilibrium. Any phase with its Gibbs energy\ncurve above the tangent surface is not stable under given compositions\nof the system.\n",

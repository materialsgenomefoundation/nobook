In a\nheterogeneous system at equilibrium, this equation can be applied to\nindividual phases as each phase is homogeneous. Noting that each\npotential has the same value in all phases at equilibrium, can be\nwritten as follows for each individual phase, $\\ \\beta$, in the system\nat equilibrium\n\nEq. \u2011\n$0 = - S^{\\beta}dT - V^{\\beta}d( - P) - \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}^{\\beta}d\\mu}_{i}$\n\nFor a system with $p$ phases at equilibrium, there are $p$ such\nequations relating the potentials in the system. The number of\nindependent potentials thus becomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\upsilon = c + 2 - p$\n\nis called Gibbs phase rule. It dictates the number of potentials that\ncan change independently for a given number of phases co-existing at\nequilibrium, commonly called degree of freedom of the system at\nequilibrium. It stipulates that the maximum number of phases can\nco-exist in a system at equilibrium is obtained by setting\n$\\upsilon = 0$, called an invariant equilibrium due to the zero degree\nof freedom,\n\nEq. \u2011 $p_{\\max} = c + 2$\n\nThere are thus maximum three phases in a one-component system, four\nphases in a binary system, five phases in a ternary system, and so on,\nthat can co-exist simultaneously at equilibrium with all potentials in\nthe system at fixed values. This should not be confused with the total\nnumber of phases that could exist, but not co-exist in a system, which\nof course are not limited by Gibbs phase rule.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the degree of freedom, $\\upsilon$, is\nreferred to the number of potentials only, not to molar quantities of\nthe system because molar quantities are generally not homogeneous in a\nheterogeneous system. For example, in a system at equilibrium with\n$\\upsilon = 0$, the amount of each component can be varied, while\nkeeping the number of phases at $p_{\\max} = c + 2$. This can be done\nthrough changing the amount of each phase in the system through the mass\nbalance equation, , without altering the composition of each phase and\nthus the chemical potentials in the system. As mentioned at the\nbeginning of Chapter , the number of independent variables in a system\nat equilibrium, i.e. the sum of independent potentials and independent\nmolar quantities, is $c + 2$ with the maximum number of independent\npotentials determined by Gibbs phase rule, .\n",

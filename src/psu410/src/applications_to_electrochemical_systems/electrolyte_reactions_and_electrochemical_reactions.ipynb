A simple\nexample is the strong electrolyte NaCl(s) dissolving in water to produce\nsolvated ions\n\n*Eq. 8\u20111* $NaCl(s)\\ \\  = \\ \\ {Na}^{+}(aq)\\ \\  + \\ \\ {Cl}^{\u2013}(aq)$\n\nwhere the $(aq)$ indicates the ionic species in an aqueous solution. In\nthis system, the ion concentrations must become quite large before the\nsolution is saturated and can exist in equilibrium with $NaCl(s)$. Its\nreaction constant, defined by , is shown as\n$K_{e} = \\ \\ a_{{Na}^{+}}a_{{Cl}^{-}}$. If the product of the ion\nactivities is less than $K_{e}$, the solution is not saturated, and more\n$NaCl(s)\\ \\ $ can be dissolved.\n\nThe precipitation of $AgCl(s)$, a weak electrolyte, occurs quite readily\nwhen ${Cl}^{\u2013}$ ions are added to an aqueous solution containing\n${Ag}^{+}(aq)$:\n\n*Eq. 8\u20112* ${Ag}^{+}(aq)\\  + \\ \\ {Cl}^{\u2013}(aq)\\  = AgCl(s)$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction,\n$K_{e} = \\ \\frac{1}{\\left( a_{{Ag}^{+}}a_{{Cl}^{-}} \\right)}$ is quite\nlarge, so the equilibrium product of the ion activities, proportional to\ntheir concentrations, is quite small. In the laboratory, the above\nreaction could occur as a result of adding hydrochloric acid to a silver\nnitrate solution. The accompanying $H^{+}(aq)$ \\[or ${H_{3}O}^{+}(aq)$\\]\nand ${NO_{3}}^{-}(aq)$ ions in solution are not directly involved in the\nsilver chloride precipitation reaction so are not shown in reaction\nrepresented by .\n\nThe above ionic equilibria in the $AgCl(s) - H_{2}O$ system is not only\nimportant for understanding this electrolyte system, but also critical\nin electrochemical systems in which *Ag(s)* undergoes a valence change\nat one electrode and reacts with a ${Cl}^{\u2013}(aq)$ ion to produce\n*AgCl(s)*, and an electron that is externally transported finite\ndistances to another electrode. The *oxidation* reaction occurs at the\nAg/AgCl electrode (*anode* half-cell reaction where electrons are\n*added* into the system)\n\n*Eq. 8\u20113* $Ag(s)\\ \\  + \\ {Cl}^{-}(aq)\\ \\  = \\ \\ AgCl(s)\\ \\  + \\ \\ e^{-}$\n\nA *reduction* reaction occurs at the other electrode (*cathode*\nhalf-cell reaction where electrons are *consumed* by the reaction)\n\n*Eq. 8\u20114* $\\frac{1}{2}{Cl}_{2}(g) + \\ \\ e^{-} = \\ {Cl}^{-}(aq)\\ \\ $\n\nThe *net cell reaction* results in the formation AgCl(s) from its\nelements\n\n*Eq. 8\u20115* $Ag(s)\\ \\  + \\frac{1}{2}{Cl}_{2}\\ (g)\\  = \\ \\ AgCl(s)$\n\nWithout knowledge of the physical system under which the reaction is\noccurring, it would not be possible to know if reaction of was a result\nof chlorine gas reacting directly with Ag(s), or if the reaction was\npart of an electrochemical cell with a transport of electrons and ions\nover finite distances. The addition of the two half-cell reactions gives\nthe *net cell reaction*, which does not show electrons as either\nreactant or product species and may or may not include ionic species in\nthe reaction*.* A schematic of an electrochemical cell for the above\nsystem is shown in Figure 8\u20111.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic diagram of an electrochemical cell consisting of a\nchlorine electrode and a silver-silver chloride electrode.\n\nOxidation and reduction can occur in electrolyte reactions without\ncreating an electrochemical cell. This is the case when chlorine gas\nreacts directly with silver on a Ag(s) surface. Reaction of above is the\nnet reaction for this process, but the electrons produced from the\noxidation of Ag(s) are not transported over finite distances before\ncombining with Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) in its reduction to Cl<sup>\u2013</sup>(aq).\nNo anode or cathode half-cell reactions exist in this system. The\nelectrons and ions involved in the reaction move only over atomic-scale\ndistances.\n",

      "source": "### Metastability and passivation\n\nOur modern industrial society is built on various metals such as Fe, Ni,\nAl, Ti, and Zr alloys which are reactive, but exhibit extraordinary\nkinetic stabilities in oxidizing environments due to the existence of a\nthin reaction product film on the surface. This film effectively\nisolates the metal from the corrosive environment, a phenomenon called\npassivation. One interesting experiment by Faraday in 1836 who reported\nthat iron corrodes freely in dilute nitric acid, while in concentrated\nnitric acid, no reaction apparently occurred. To understand this\nphenomenon, let us exam a simple, schematic Pourbaix diagram for the\niron-water system shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic Pourbaix diagram for iron illustrating the\nresolution of the Faraday paradox in the corrosion of iron in nitric\nacid \\[61\\]. Lines (a) (b), and (c) correspond to the equilibria: (a)\n$H^{+} + e^{-} = 1/2H_{2}$; (b) $O_{2} + 4H^{+} + 4e^{-} = 2H_{2}O$; (c)\n$NO_{3}^{-} + 3H^{+} + 2e^{-} = HNO_{2} + H_{2}O$, respectively\n\nFor iron in deaerated acid solution, the partial anodic and cathodic\nreactions are Line 1 $\\left( Fe/{Fe}^{2 +} \\right)$ and Line (a),\nrespectively, resulting in a corrosion potential that lies between Lines\n$1$ and $a$. In oxygenated (aerated) solutions, the corrosion potential\nmay lie between Lines $1$ and $b$, because the reduction of oxygen is a\npossible (likely) cathodic reaction. Since dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> is\nonly a weak oxidizing agent, the principal cathodic reaction was most\nlikely hydrogen evolution, and hence the corrosion potential is expected\nto lie between Lines $1$ and $a$ at relatively high pH, as shown. Since\nthe $Fe/{Fe}^{2 +}$ reaction is relatively fast compared with\n$H^{+}/H_{2}$ on iron, if the corrosion potential is situated below the\nextension of Line 2 (Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) into the\n${Fe}^{2 +}$ stability region, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cannot form\non the surface, even as a metastable phase.\n\nOn the other hand, concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> is a strong oxidizing\nagent due to the reaction:\n$NO_{3}^{-} + 3H^{+} + 2e^{-} = HNO_{2} + H_{2}O$, so that the corrosion\npotential can lie anywhere between Lines $1$ and $c$ at low pH. Since\nReaction (2) is likely to be fast, the corrosion potential will be high\nand certainly will be more positive than the extension of Line 2 into\nthe stability region for ${Fe}^{2 +}$ at low pH. Therefore,\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> becomes metastable and can form between the\naqueous solution and iron. The thickness of this\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> film depends on its dissolution rate into\nthe aqueous solution and its growth rate at the interface with iron,\nwhich depends on the diffusion of ionic species across the film. Its\nexistence results in passivity and the observed kinetic inactivity of\niron in this medium. When the potential becomes even more positive above\nthe extension of Line $3$, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may form on\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as an additional metastable phase, resulting\nin the commonly observed bilayer structure.\n",

The chemical potential\ndifference of oxygen between two sides of a membrane provides the\ndriving force for oxygen to diffuse through the membrane. Commonly used\nITM oxides include perovskite and fluorite, with the chemical formula of\nABO<sub>3</sub> and AO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, typically with more\nthan one elements in the A-site and / or the B-site to tailor the\nelectron and ionic conductivities. Key thermodynamic properties of ITM\noxides are their stability in service environments, vacancy\nconcentrations in the oxygen and cation sites, valances of cations. On\nthe high oxygen partial pressure side, the reaction is as the following\n\n*Eq. 8\u201169* $\\frac{1}{2}O_{2} + 2e^{-} = O^{2 -}$\n\nAt the same time the number of oxygen vacancy is reduced, resulting in a\nlower concentration of oxygen vacancy and higher oxygen activity in the\noxide on the high oxygen partial pressure side.

High vacancy concentrations can be obtained by\ncation dopants with lower valances or small energy differences between\nvarious valance states. However, at the same time, high vacancy\nconcentrations reduce the thermodynamic stability of the membrane, which\nmay result in its decomposition into more stable phases.\n",

The actual voltage of a\nbattery is lower than the theoretical one due to kinetic limitations of\ncell reactions and resistance to ion diffusion through the electrolyte.\nBased on whether the cell reactions are reversible or not, batteries\ntypically categorized as either primary disposable or secondary\nrechargeable batteries. The net cell reactions in primary disposable\nbatteries are not easily reversible, and electrode materials may not\nreturn to their original forms by applying a higher external potential\nof opposite sign. Consequently, primary batteries cannot be reliably\nrecharged. On the other hand, the net cell reactions in secondary\nbatteries are easily reversible. Furthermore, two half-cells in\nbatteries may use different electrolytes with each half-cell enclosed in\na container and a separator permeable to conducting ions but not the\nbulk of the electrolytes.\n\nOne common primary battery is zinc-carbon battery with a zinc anode\ncylinder and a carbon cathode central rod. The electrolytes are ammonium\nor zinc chloride next to the zinc anode and a mixture of ammonium\nchloride and manganese dioxide next to the carbon cathode. The half cell\nand net reactions with ammonium chloride are as follows\n\n*Eq. 8\u201174* Zn + 2NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192\nZn(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + 2 e<sup>-</sup>\n\n*Eq. 8\u201175* 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 2MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup> \u2192\n2NH<sub>3</sub> + Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> +\nH<sub>2</sub>O+2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n*Eq. 8\u201176* Zn + 2MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl \u2192\nMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> +\nZn(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nThe electric potential of the reaction is, treating all compounds as\nstoichiometric compounds\n\nEq. 8\u201177\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}G}{2f} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}^{0}G}{2f} = \\frac{1}{2f}\\left(_{\\ }^{0}G^{Zn} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{{MnO}_{2}} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{{NH}_{4}Cl} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}O} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{Zn\\left( {NH}_{3} \\right)_{2}{Cl}_{2}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{{{Mn}_{2}O}_{3}} \\right)$.\n\nThe Gibbs energy of $Zn\\left( {NH}_{3} \\right)_{2}{Cl}_{2}$ is not\navailable in current databases and has been recently estimated to be\n\u2212505,375 J/mole-formula \\[62\\]. The value of at 298.15K is thus obtained\nas 1.67 V, which is pretty close to the actual operating voltage of the\nbattery around 1.5 V.\n\nWhile with zinc chloride, the cell reactions and electric potential may\nbe written as\n\nEq. 8\u201178 Zn + ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 2ZnOHCl + 2\ne<sup>-</sup>\n\n*Eq. 8\u201179* MnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + e<sup>-</sup> \u2192 MnOOH +\nOH<sup>-</sup>\n\n*Eq. 8\u201180* Zn + 2 MnO<sub>2</sub> + ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\u2192 2 MnOOH + 2 ZnOHCl\n\n*Eq. 8\u201181*\n$\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2f}\\left(_{\\ }^{0}G^{Zn} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{{MnO}_{2}} +_{\\ }^{0}G^{Zn{Cl}_{2}} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}O} - 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{MnOOH} - 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{ZnOHCl} \\right)$\n\nSecondary batteries can be recharged by applying an external electrical\npotential, which reverses the net cell reaction that occur during\ndischarging. The oldest form of rechargeable battery is the lead-acid\nbatteries used in automotive, and the latest development is the\nlithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. A lead-acid battery typically uses Pb\nand PbO2 as the cathode and anode electrodes and a 35% sulfuric acid and\n65% water solution as the electrolyte. Its anode and cathode reactions\ncan be simplified as follows\n\nEq. 8\u201182 $Pb + SO_{4}^{2 -} = PbSO_{4} + 2e^{-}$\n\nEq. 8\u201183 $PbO_{2} + 4H^{+} + SO_{4}^{2 -} + 2e^{-} = PbSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O$\n\nThe net cell reaction is\n\nEq. 8\u201184 $Pb + PbO_{2} + 2H_{2}SO_{4}^{\\ } = 2PbSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O$.\n\nIts electric potential is represented by the following equation\n\n*Eq. 8\u201185*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{2f}\\left( 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}O} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{{PbSO}_{4}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{Pb} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{{PbO}_{2}} - 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}SO_{4}} \\right)$\n\nwith the value at 298.15K being 2.651 V calculated from Thermo-Calc\n\\[60\\]. During discharging, the reaction goes to right, and $PbSO_{4}$\nis formed on both anode and cathode, while during charging, the reaction\ngoes to the left, and $Pb$ and $PbO_{2}$ are restored. In practical\napplications, other ionic species such as ${H_{3}O}^{+}$ and\n$HSO_{4}^{-}$ may form in the electrolyte, complicating the reactions\nand affecting its potential.\n\nIn lithium ion batteries, lithium ions migrate in electrolytes between\nelectrodes made of intercalated lithium compounds during charging and\ndischarging. LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> are two of the\nseveral cathode materials used in lithium ion batteries, and the anode\nis typically made of carbon or metallic Li. The anode and cathode\nreactions for LiCoO2 batteries can be written in simple forms as follows\n\nEq. 8\u201186 ${Li}_{x}C_{6} = x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + 6C$\n\nEq. 8\u201187 $x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + {Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2} = LiCoO_{2}$\n\nwith the net reaction and electric potential being\n\nEq. 8\u201188 ${Li}_{x}C_{6} + {Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2} = LiCoO_{2} + 6C$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201189*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{xf}\\left\\{ 6_{\\ }^{0}G^{C} +_{\\ }^{0}G^{{LiCoO}_{2}} - G^{{{Li}_{x}C}_{6}} - G^{{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO}_{2}} \\right\\} = - \\frac{1}{f}\\left\\{ \\left( \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}} - \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{x}C} \\right) - \\frac{1}{x}\\left( \\mu_{LiCoO_{2}}^{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{{LiCoO}_{2}} \\right) \\right\\}$\n\nThe electric potential is a function of $x$. The value in the first\nparenthesis in the above equation denotes the chemical potential\ndifference of Li between two electrodes, and the value in the second\nparenthesis represents the chemical potential difference of\n${LiCoO}_{2}$ between the states in the solution phase of\n${Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}$ and by itself. Gibbs energies of ${{Li}_{x}C}_{6}$\nand ${{Li}_{1 - x}CoO}_{2}$ need to be obtained as a function $x$ in\norder to calculate the electric potential of the battery.\n\nLiFePO<sub>4</sub> uses metallic lithium as the anode with following\nhalf-cell and net cell reactions\n\nEq. 8\u201190 $xLi = x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-}$\n\nEq. 8\u201191 $x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + {Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4} = LiFePO_{4}$\n\nEq. 8\u201192 $xLi + {Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4} = LiFePO_{4}$.\n\nIts electric potential is also a function of $x$, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201193*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{xf}\\left\\{_{\\ }^{0}G^{LiFePO_{4}} - x\\ ^{0}G^{Li} - G^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} \\right\\} = - \\frac{1}{f}\\left\\{ \\left( \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} - \\ ^{0}\\mu_{Li} \\right) - \\frac{1}{x}\\left( \\mu_{LiFePO_{4}}^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{LiFePO_{4}} \\right) \\right\\}$\n\nThe value in the first parenthesis in the above equation denotes the\nchemical potential difference of Li between two electrodes, and the\nvalue in the second parenthesis represents the chemical potential\ndifference of $LiFePO_{4}$ between the states in the solution phase of\n${Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}$ and by itself. Consequently, Gibbs energy of\n${Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}$ needs to be obtained as a function $x$ in order\nto calculate the electric potential of the battery. It is known that\nthere are several miscibility gaps in the $FePO_{4}$ and $LiFePO_{4}$\npsuedo-binary system, in which the chemical potentials are constants, so\nis the electric potential, resulting in stable battery output.\n",

      "source": "### Half cell potentials\n\nWhen electron current flows between electrodes, reactions are occurring\nat the electrodes and concentration gradients causing polarization\ndevelop around the electrodes. These gradients result in extraneous\npotentials to occur at the electrodes. In such cases cell equilibrium is\nnot established and measured cell potentials are not those for true\npartial equilibrium. If a cell is short-circuited with the electrodes\nconnected by a conductor, current will flow until the external potential\nbecomes zero, i.e. \u03b5<sub>ext</sub> = 0, and equilibrium is established\nwith same conditions as non-electrochemical systems. If an external\npotential, \u03b5<sub>ext</sub>, is applied to the cell, chemical reactions\noccur until the cell potential balances to \u03b5<sub>ext</sub>, and no\ncurrent flows. This potential is called open-circuit voltage (OCV) in\nthe literature. It is important to realize that OCV includes all\nreactions that occur on the electrode surface when the electrode is in\ncontact with the electrolyte, such as passivation discussed in Chapter .\nPartial equilibrium in a cell is achieved when the cell potential is\nbalanced by an applied external potential. In such partial equilibrium\ncases, equilibrium thermodynamic analyses can be used even though the\ncell potential is not zero, i.e. \u03b5<sub>cell</sub> \u2260 0. This\ndifferentiates electrochemical systems from other equilibrium systems\ndiscussed previously.\n\nThe number of electrons involved in a net cell reaction is important in\nrelating cell potential and the Gibbs energy change for the cell\nreaction. As will be illustrated later in this section, this number\ndenotes the number of electrons involved in the half-cell reactions that\nwere added to yield the net cell reaction. The electrical work achieved\nby the transport of an electrical charge through a cell potential can be\nwritten as\n\n*Eq. 8\u201120* $w = z\\ f\\ \\varepsilon$\n\nwhere *z* represents the moles of electrons in cell reaction, *f* the\nFaraday constant equal to 96,485 J/V/mole-electron, and *\u03b5* the\npotential difference, often referred as electromotive force (emf) in the\nliterature. For a system at constant temperature, pressure, and\ncomposition, this work is the same as the Gibbs energy difference\nbetween the two electrodes, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201121* $- \\Delta G = w = zf\\varepsilon$\n\nwhere the negative sign is because the system does work to the\nsurrounding when the Gibbs energy of the system is decreased. When the\napplied external potential is larger than the cell potential, the\nsurrounding does work to the system, and a common example is the\ncharging of a battery. Thermodynamic relations discussed in previous\nchapters can thus be directly applied to electrochemical systems with\nsome common equations shown in .\n\nTable \u2011: Thermodynamic Equations for Electrochemical Cells\n\n*\u2206G = -z f \u03b5*\n\n*\u2206S = - (\u2202\u2206G/\u2202T)P = + z f (\u2202\u03b5/\u2202T)P*\n\n*\u2206H = \\[\u2202(\u2206G/T)/ \u2202(1/T)\\]P = - z f \\[\u2202(\u03b5/T)/\u2202(1/T)\\]P = z f \\[T(\u2202\u03b5/\u2202T)P\n\u2013 \u03b5\\]*\n\n*\u2206CP = (\u2202\u2206H/\u2202T)P = T z f (\u22022\u03b5/\u2202T2)P*\n\nA half-cell reaction potential cannot be measured directly, only its\npotential relative to another half-cell reaction. By convention, a\nstandard half-cell potential is measured relative to the standard\nhydrogen half-cell reduction reaction at 25<sup>o</sup>C (298K) and 1\nbar, which has a defined standard potential of zero volts,\n\n*Eq. 8\u201122* H<sup>+</sup>(aq, a=1) + e<sup>-</sup> = 1/2 H<sub>2</sub>(g,\n1 bar)\n\nwith \u03b5<sup>o</sup> (H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>,g) = 0.00 volts. The\nstandard half-cell reduction reactions of metals at 25<sup>o</sup>C are\nfor the general reaction\n\n*Eq. 8\u201123* M<sup>z+</sup>(aq, a=1) + z e<sup>-</sup> = M(s)\n\nwith \u03b5<sup>o</sup> (M<sup>z+</sup>/M) volts. Half-cell reactions with\nthe most positive standard electrode potentials have a tendency to\nspontaneously proceed toward reduction (cathode reactions). Half-cell\nreactions with the most negative standard electrode potentials have a\ntendency to spontaneously proceed toward oxidation (anode reactions).\n\nConsider, for example, a cell made up of a standard hydrogen electrode\nand a standard zinc electrode with \u03b5<sup>o</sup>\n(H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>,g) = 0.00 volts and \u03b5<sup>o</sup>\n(Zn<sup>2+</sup>/Zn) = -0.762 volts. Thus, the H<sup>+</sup> would tend\nto be reduced, and the zinc metal would tend to be oxidized, and the\nspontaneous reaction if all species had unit activities would be\n\n*Eq. 8\u201124* 2 H<sup>+</sup>(aq, a=1)+ Zn = H<sub>2</sub>(1 bar) +\nZn<sup>2+</sup>(aq, a=1)\n\nwith \u03b5<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = 0.762 volts and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G = - 2*96485*\\varepsilon_{cell}^{0}\\ $. The\ncathode half-cell reaction would be the same as , while the anode\nhalf-cell reaction would be\n\n*Eq. 8\u201125* Zn = Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq, a=1) + 2 e<sup>-</sup>\n\nWhen ion concentrations and H<sub>2</sub> gas do not all have unit\nactivities, the Gibbs energy and cell potential of the cell reaction, ,\nbecomes\n\n*Eq. 8\u201126*\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{a_{{Zn}^{2 +}}P_{H_{2}}}{\\left( a_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}}$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201127*\n$\\varepsilon_{cell} = \\varepsilon_{cell}^{0} - \\frac{RT}{zf}\\ln\\frac{a_{{Zn}^{2 +}}P_{H_{2}}}{\\left( a_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}}$\n\nThe standard reduction potentials of some common metals at\n25<sup>o</sup>C are given in .\n\nTable \u2011: Standard reduction potentials of some common metals\n\nA cell reaction can be established by different half-cell reactions. For\nexample, the following reaction can be derived from two different cells\n\n*Eq. 8\u201128* $3\\ {Fe}^{2 + \\ }\\  = \\ \\ 2\\ {Fe}^{3 +}\\ \\  + \\ \\ Fe(s)$\n\ncell A\n\n*Eq. 8\u201129* $3{Fe}^{2 +} + \\ 6\\ e - \\  = \\ \\ 3Fe(s)$ \u03b5o<sub>1</sub> =\n-0.440 V\n\n*Eq. 8\u201130* $2\\ Fe(s)\\ \\  = \\ \\ 2\\ {Fe}^{3 +}\\ \\  + \\ 6\\ e -$\n\u03b5o<sub>2</sub> = +0.036 V\n\ncell B\n\n*Eq. 8\u201131* $2{Fe}^{2 +}\\  = \\ 2{Fe}^{3 + \\ \\ } + 2\\ e^{-}$\n*\u03b5o<sub>4</sub> = -0.772 V*\n\n*Eq. 8\u201132* ${Fe}^{2 + \\ }\\  + \\ 2\\ e - \\ \\  = \\ \\ Fe(s)$ *\u03b5o<sub>5</sub>\n= -0.440 V*\n\nBoth give the same net reaction shown by , but with 6 and 2 electrons\nand standard cell potentials being \u03b5o<sub>cell A</sub> = -0.404 V and\n\u03b5o<sub>cell B</sub> = -1.212 V, respectively. However, the standard\nGibbs energies of both cells are the same, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201133* $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$*<sub>cell A</sub> = -6 f (-0.404)\n= + 2.424 f*\n\n*Eq. 8\u201134* $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$*<sub>cell B</sub> = -2 f (-1.212)\n= + 2.424 f*\n\nIt is shown that $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$ values are independent of\nhalf-cell reactions and depend only on the net reaction because the net\nreaction is neutral in electron and balanced in mass.\n",

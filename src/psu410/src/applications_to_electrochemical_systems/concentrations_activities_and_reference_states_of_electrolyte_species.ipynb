In most studies of electrochemical\ncorrosion and electrodeposition, and in applied work of electrochemical\nengineers, ionic species concentrations are given in units of molarity,\nthe number of moles of a species in a liter of solution (mol/l)\nsymbolically represented in equations by either *c<sub>i</sub>* or\n\\[M<sup>+Z</sup>\\]. The other common concentration used for ionic\nspecies is molality, which is defined as the number of moles of a\nspecies in 1000g of solvent. For dilute aqueous solutions, molarity and\nmolality values are very similar.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter , a practical definition of the activity of a\nspecies *i* is the thermodynamic reactivity, or tendency to react, of\nspecies *i* in the system of interest as compared to *i* in its\nreference state form. The reference state of a species is typically\nchosen as a specific chemical/physical state of the species at 1 atm\nexternal pressure and the temperature of interest. Similarly, a typical\nreference state for ionic species in aqueous solutions is the 1 molar\nideal solution at 1 bar external pressure and the temperature of\ninterest. If an electrolyte solution behaves ideally, then the activity\nof species *i* in solution is\n\n*Eq. 8\u20116*\n$a_{i} = \\frac{c_{i}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)}{c_{i}^{0}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)} = \\frac{c_{i}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)}{1\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)} = c_{i}(dimensionless)$\n\nwhere $c_{i}$ is the molar concentration of *i* in the solution divided\nby $c_{i}^{0}$, the 1 molar reference state ideal solution\nconcentration. Thus, in ideal solutions, the activity of an electrolyte\nspecies is numerically equal to its molar concentration. The above\ntreatment of ionic species is equivalent to the common practice of\ndepicting the activity of a gas by the value of its ideal gas partial\npressure in units of bar.\n\nThe activity coefficient corrects for the nonideality of the species in\nsolution as defined in . If the solution is ideal, $\\gamma_{i} = 1$ for\nall concentrations of a species in solution. For all solutions, one\nexpects $\\gamma_{i} \\rightarrow 1$ as $c_{i} \\rightarrow 1$. It is not\npossible to measure $\\gamma_{i^{+}}$ or $\\gamma_{i^{-}}$ for individual\ncharged ions, only a geometric mean of the positive and negative ion\nvalues. Consider the following ionic solution\n\nEq. 8\u20117\n\nIts chemical potential can be written as\n\n*Eq. 8\u20118*\n\nIts geometric average or mean activity and activity coefficient are\ndefined as\n\n*Eq. 8\u20119*\n\n*Eq. 8\u201110*\n\nFor example, one can define\n$\\gamma_{\\pm} = \\left( \\gamma_{{Na}^{+}}\\gamma_{{Cl}^{-}} \\right)^{1/2}$\nand\n$\\gamma_{\\pm} = \\left( \\gamma_{{Al}^{3 +}}^{2}\\gamma_{{{SO}_{4}}^{2 -}}^{3} \\right)^{1/5}$\nfor NaCl and Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, respectively.\nFor idea, weak electrolytes, $\\gamma_{\\pm} = 1$, and for non-ideal,\nstrong electrolytes, $\\gamma_{\\pm} \\neq 1$.\n",

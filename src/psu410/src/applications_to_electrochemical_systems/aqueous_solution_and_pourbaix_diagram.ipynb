Since many electrochemical\nprocesses involve electrolyte solutions in an aqueous solvent,\nelectrochemical processes including water, hydrogen, and/or oxygen are\ndiscussed in more details. The hydrogen-oxygen cell can be described for\nboth acidic electrolytes and alkaline electrolytes. With acidic\nelectrolytes, H<sup>+</sup> is in much higher concentrations than\nOH<sup>-</sup>, and thus half-cell reactions with H<sup>+</sup> as an\nionic transport species are more important than those involving\nOH<sup>-</sup>. The reverse is true for alkaline electrolytes that\ncontain high OH<sup>-</sup>concentrations. Other than for nearly neutral\nacid-base systems, either H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> dominates the\nother by several orders of magnitude as can be seen from the value of\nthe 298 K dissociation constant for H<sub>2</sub>O:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201135* H<sub>2</sub>O(l) = H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)\n\nwith the reaction constant being K<sub>e</sub> =\n\\[H<sup>+</sup>\\]\\[OH<sup>-</sup>\\] = 10<sup>-14</sup> and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$= -RT *ln* K<sub>e</sub> *\u03b2*= +79,908 J. By\nconvention, one defines pH = - log \\[H<sup>+</sup>\\] and pOH = - log\n\\[OH<sup>-</sup>\\], and then pH + pOH = 14.\n\nUnder acidic electrolyte conditions of low pH (high \\[H<sup>+</sup>\\]\nconcentrations) the anode reaction in a hydrogen-oxygen cell is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201136* \u00bd H<sub>2</sub>(g) = H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup>\n\nwith \u03b5<sub>1</sub><sup>o</sup> = 0.0 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{1}$= 0 J. The corresponding cathode\n(reduction) reaction is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201137* 2 H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + \u00bd O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2 e<sup>-</sup> =\nH<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\nwith \u03b5<sub>2</sub><sup>o</sup> = 1.229 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{2}$ = -2\\*1.229\\*96,485 J = -237,160 J. The\nnet cell reaction for acidic electrolytes is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201138* H<sub>2</sub>(g) + \u00bd O<sub>2</sub>(g) = H<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\nwith \u03b5<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = 1.229 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{cell}$ = -2\\*1.229\\*96,485 J = -237,160 J\n\nUnder alkaline electrolyte conditions of high pH (high\n\\[OH<sup>-</sup>\\] concentrations) the anode reaction in a\nhydrogen-oxygen cell is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201139* 2 OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g) = 2\nH<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 2 e<sup>-</sup>\n\nwith \u03b5<sub>3</sub><sup>o</sup> = 0.828 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{3}$= -2\\*0.828\\*96,485 J = -159,779 J. The\ncorresponding cathode (reduction) reaction is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201140* H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + \u00bd O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2 e<sup>-</sup> = 2\nOH<sup>-</sup>(aq)\n\nwith \u03b5<sub>4</sub><sup>o</sup> = 0.401 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{4}$ = -2\\*0.401\\*96,485 J = -77,381 J. The\nnet cell reaction for alkaline electrolytes is:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201141* H<sub>2</sub>(g) + \u00bd O<sub>2</sub>(g) = H<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\nwith \u03b5<sup>o</sup><sub>cell</sub> = 1.229 V and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G_{cell}$ = -2\\*1.229\\*96,485 J = -237,160 J.\n\nPlots of \u03b5 versus pH for a given chemical system have been typically\nused to exhibit the stability relationships of ionic species and solid\nphases in aqueous-based electrochemical systems. These graphs are often\ncalled Pourbaix diagrams after the inventor and are at constant\ntemperature and constant pressure diagrams for a constant concentration,\nusually for one metallic element. By convention, the \u03b5 in a Pourbaix\ndiagram corresponds to the potential for the cathode reduction reactions\nin the electrochemical half-cell with electrons as reactants. Pourbaix\ndiagrams can be extended to multi-component materials when thermodynamic\nproperties of the components are available in both the materials and the\naqueous solution.\n\nAn example of an \u03b5 versus pH diagram is shown in for the\nNi-H<sub>2</sub>O system at a 298K, 1 bar, and $c_{{Ni}^{2 +}} = 0.001$\nmolality. Three stability regions for Ni species are shown: Ni(s),\nNiO(s), and \\[Ni<sup>2+</sup>\\]. The two dashed lines on this diagram\ncorrespond to hydrogen reduction () and oxygen reduction () reactions,\nrespectively.\n\nFigure \u2011: An \u03b5 versus pH, Pourbaix diagram for the Ni-H<sub>2</sub>O at\n298K, 1 bar, and $c_{{Ni}^{2 +}} = 0.001$ molality.\n\nFor the \u03b5 and pH conditions within the boundaries of the Ni(s) region,\nno solid phase other than Ni(s) is stable, no ionic species with a\nconcentration of 1 molarity is stable, and no gas species with a\npressure of 1 bar is stable. Similar statements could be made about the\nNiO(s) and \\[Ni<sup>2+</sup>\\] areas on the diagram. In the\n\\[Ni<sup>2+</sup>\\] area, introduction of Ni(s) or NiO(s) into the\nsystem would result in the dissolution of these solid phases since they\nare not stable with respect to the \\[Ni<sup>2+</sup>\\] aqueous solution.\nThe corresponding chemical reactions proceed spontaneously to the right\nas follows until the solid phases are consumed:\n\n*Eq. 8\u201142* Ni(s) \u2192 Ni<sup>2+</sup>(1 molarity) + 2 e<sup>-</sup>\n\n*Eq. 8\u201143* NiO(s) + 2 H<sup>+</sup>(aq) \u2192 Ni<sup>2+</sup>(1 molarity) +\nH<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\nNo H<sup>+</sup>(aq) in involved in the first reaction, , so the\nboundary line separating Ni(s) and Ni<sup>2+</sup> is independent of pH.\nNo oxidation or reduction occurs in the second reaction, , i.e. no\nelectrons are reactants or products in the reaction, the boundary line\nseparating NiO(s) and Ni<sup>2+</sup> is independent of \u03b5.\n\nNote the convention that the \u03b5 is the potential for a cathode reduction\nreaction, and boundary lines between two stability regions depict\nconditions under which partial equilibrium occurs for the two species\nfor the \u03b5 and pH values at any point on these lines. For the boundary\nline separating Ni(s) and Ni<sup>2+</sup> in an ideal aqueous solution,\ni.e. the reverse of , the following equation is obtained.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201144* \u03b5 = \u03b5<sup>o</sup> = -0.268 V\n\nFor the NiO(s)-Ni<sup>2+</sup> boundary line of an ideal solution, the\nreaction, , is a complete equilibrium, and thus the relationship is\n\n*Eq. 8\u201145*\n$0 = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + 2 \\cdot 2.303 \\cdot RT \\cdot pH$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201146*\n$pH = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G}{2 \\cdot 2.303 \\cdot RT}$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$ is obtained as follows and can be\ncalculated from the SSUB database and the standard potential of Ni,\n\n*Eq. 8\u201147*\n\nAt a specified temperature, only one standard free energy and only one\nequilibrium constant exists for this chemical reaction, and thus only\none specific value of $pH = 6.631$ exists for the reaction represented\nby in this Pourbaix diagram.\n\nThe diagonal line in represents the equilibrium between Ni(s) and NiO(s)\nand is for a partial equilibrium reaction that is the sum of reactions\nof and\n\n*Eq. 8\u201148* NiO(s) + 2 H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + 2 e<sup>-</sup> \u2550 Ni(s) +\nH<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\nThe reduction of Ni from a divalent state in NiO to metallic Ni(s)\noccurs, but the reaction also depends on the H<sup>+</sup>\nconcentration, the pH. The corresponding Gibbs energy and Nernst\nequations are,\n\n*Eq. 8\u201149*\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}} = - 23,939 + 2 \\cdot 2.303 \\cdot RT \\cdot pH$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201150*\n$\\varepsilon\\  = \\ \\varepsilon^{0}\\  - \\ \\frac{RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}}\\  = 0.124\\ \u2013\\ \\frac{2.303 \\cdot RT}{f}pH$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$ can be calculated as follows\n\n*Eq. 8\u201151*\n\nThe two additional lines in correspond to the reduction reactions\nrelated to H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases, i.e. the stability of\nH<sub>2</sub>O. The lower one is for the reverse of under \u03b5<sup>o</sup>\n= 0 and $P_{H_{2}} = 1$ with the Nernst equation being\n\n*Eq. 8\u201152*\n$\\varepsilon\\  = \\ \\varepsilon^{0}\\  - \\ \\frac{RT}{f}\\ln\\frac{\\left( P_{H_{2}} \\right)^{1/2}}{c_{H^{+}}}\\  = - \\frac{2.303 \\cdot RT}{f}pH$\n\nAs the pH increases from 0, \u03b5 becomes more negative as is depicted. The\ntop dashed line corresponds to the oxygen reduction reaction represented\nby under \u03b5<sup>o</sup> = 1.225 calculated from the aqueous solution\ndatabase in Thermo-Calc \\[60\\] and $P_{O_{2}} = 1$ with the Nernst\nequation being\n\nEq. 8\u201153\n$\\varepsilon\\  = \\ \\varepsilon^{0}\\  - \\ \\frac{RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{\\left( P_{O_{2}} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( c_{H^{+}} \\right)^{2}}\\  = 1.225\\ \u2013\\ \\frac{2.303 \\cdot RT}{f}pH$\n\nThe dependence of \u03b5 on pH is identical for both reduction reaction and ,\nand their intercepts at $pH = 0$ differ by their difference in their\n\u03b5<sup>o</sup> values.\n\nIn this simple Pourbaix diagram of Ni in an ideal aqueous solution, all\nboundary lines are straight because there is only one ionic species of\nNi in the aqueous solution, i.e. Ni<sup>2+</sup>. When there are more\nthan one ionic species in the aqueous solution, the boundary lines may\nno longer be straight due to the competition between species. One\nexample is Cu with two main ionic species of Cu<sup>+2</sup> and\nCuOH<sup>+</sup>, and the reduction reaction between the metallic Cu and\nthe aqueous solution involves both two species, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201154*\n${xCu}^{2 + \\ }\\  + \\ (1 - x){CuOH}^{+} + (1 - x)H^{+} + 2\\ e - \\ \\  = \\ \\ Cu(s) + {(1 - x)H}_{2}O$\n\nwith\n\n*Eq. 8\u201155*\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{{Cu}^{2 +}} \\right)^{x}\\left( c_{{CuOH}^{+}}c_{H^{+}} \\right)^{1 - x}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{{Cu}^{2 +}} \\right)^{x}\\left( c_{{CuOH}^{+}} \\right)^{1 - x}} + 2.303(1 - x) \\cdot RT \\cdot pH$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201156*\n$\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{0} - \\frac{RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\left( c_{{Cu}^{2 +}} \\right)^{x}\\left( c_{{CuOH}^{+}} \\right)^{1 - x}} - \\frac{2.303(1 - x) \\cdot RT}{2f}pH$.\n\nIt is evident that both the slope and the intercept at $pH = 0$ are a\nfunction of the concentration of ${CuOH}^{+}$, which is a function of\n$pH$. Consequently, the boundary between the metallic Cu and the aqueous\nsolution is no longer a straight line as shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: An \u03b5 versus pH, Pourbaix diagram for the Cu-H<sub>2</sub>O\nsystem at 298K, 1 bar, and $c_{Cu} = 0.001$ molality.\n\nThe concentrations of various species in the aqueous solution, i.e.\ncommonly called speciation, are plotted in , showing the change of\ndominant species as a function of pH value.\n\nFigure \u2011: Concentrations of ionic species in the aqueous solution at\n$\\varepsilon = 0.3\\ V$ from .\n\nIn Pourbaix diagrams for alloys with two or more elements, activities of\nindividual elements are to be used in calculating the potentials of\nreduction reactions. Considering a Fe-Ni alloy with Fe<sup>2+</sup> and\nNi<sup>2+</sup> in the aqueous solution, the reduction reactions for Fe\nand Ni can be written separately as\n\n*Eq. 8\u201157* Ni<sup>2+</sup>(c<sub>Ni</sub>) + 2 e<sup>-</sup> \u2192 Ni\n(a<sub>Ni</sub> in alloy)\n\n*Eq. 8\u201158* Fe<sup>2+</sup>(c<sub>Fe</sub>) + 2 e<sup>-</sup> \u2192 Fe\n(a<sub>Fe</sub> in alloy)\n\nwith their potentials as\n\n*Eq. 8\u201159*\n$\\varepsilon_{Ni}\\  = \\ \\varepsilon_{Ni}^{0} - \\frac{2.303RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{a_{Ni}}{c_{Ni}} = \\  - 0.268 - \\frac{2.303RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{a_{Ni}}{c_{Ni}}$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201160*\n$\\varepsilon_{Fe}\\  = \\ \\varepsilon_{Fe}^{0} - \\frac{2.303RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{a_{Fe}}{c_{Fe}} = \\  - 0.441 - \\frac{2.303RT}{2f}\\ln\\frac{a_{Fe}}{c_{Fe}}$\n\nIn principle, there are two scenarios for a given set of $a_{Ni}$ and\n$a_{Fe}$ of the alloy. The first scenario is at the limit of a dilute\naqueous solution, i.e. $c_{Ni} = c_{Fe} = 0.001\\ $molarity,\n$\\varepsilon_{Ni}$ and $\\varepsilon_{Fe}$ can be calculated, and the\nelement with the lower potential has the tendency to dissolve first,\nwhich can result in the so-called dialloying effect. The second scenario\nis for the equal potential, i.e. $\\varepsilon_{Ni} = \\varepsilon_{Fe}$\ndue to the externally imposed potential, and the equilibrium\nconcentrations of Fe<sup>+2</sup> and Ni<sup>+2</sup> can be calculated\nfrom and .\n",

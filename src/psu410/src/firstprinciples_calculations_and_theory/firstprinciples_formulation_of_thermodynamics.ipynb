Here,\nthe terminology microstate refers to the microscopic structure that is\ndistinguished by crystal structure, atom distributions in the lattice\nsites, and the arrangements of the local atomic spin and electronic\nangular momentum distributions among the lattice sites. From this\nsection on, the index \u03c3 is employed to label the microstate. For a solid\nmaterial at finite temperatures, a phase can be formed by a single\nmicrostate or a mixture of multiple microstates.\n\nLet us consider a canonical system made of *N* atoms with an average\natomic volume *V*. The study is limited to the motions of atomic nuclei\nand electrons. For such a system, one can use to index the energy\neigenvalues of the corresponding microscopic Hamiltonian associated with\nmicrostate *\u03c3*. The subscript **g** symbolically labels the different\nvibrational states for the motions of atomic nuclei and the subscript\n**n** symbolically labels the electronic states distinguished by the\ndifferent distributions of the electrons between the electronic valence\nand conduction bands. Neglecting electron-phonon coupling, one can\nassume that the contributions to between the vibrational and electronic\nstates are additive, so that\n\n*Eq. 5\u201116* ,\n\nwhere *E<sub>c</sub>* is the static total energy of the microstate *\u03c3*.\nNote that in and represent the energetics of the vibrational state and\nthe electronic state respectively.\n\nOne then can formulate the canonical partition function of the\nmicrostate *\u03c3* at the given temperature *T* and volume *V* as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201117* ,\n\nwhere *\u03b2* = 1/*k<sub>B</sub>T* with *k<sub>B</sub>* being the\nBoltzmann\u2019s constant.

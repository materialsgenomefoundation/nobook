After that, Fock modified the Hartree\napproximation by considering the fact that the wave function of a\nmulti-fermionic system should satisfy anti-symmetry requirements and\nsubsequently the Pauli exclusion principle that the total wave function\nchanges sign upon the exchange of fermions. Accordingly, the wave\nfunction of *N* electrons system under the Hartree-Fock approximation is\nexpressed as the Slater determinant \\[29\\]\n\n*Eq. 5\u201172*\n\nFor brevity, one can use the atomic unit that treats in , so that\n\n*Eq. 5\u201173*\n\nwhere , and\n\n*Eq. 5\u201174*\n\nAccordingly, the total energy of the system is expressed as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201175*\n\nwhere *J<sub>ij</sub>* is called as Coulomb/Hartree term\n\n*Eq. 5\u201176*\n\nwhere *K<sub>ij</sub>* is called as exchange term\n\n*Eq. 5\u201177* ,\n\nwhere = 1 if spin **s***<sub>i</sub>* and **s***<sub>j</sub>* points to\nthe same direction and = 0 if spin **s***<sub>i</sub>* and\n**s***<sub>j</sub>* points to the opposite direction.\n\nBy utilizing the variational condition of , one gets\n\n*Eq. 5\u201178* ,\n\nwhere is called one-electron energy, and\n\n*Eq. 5\u201179* ,\n\nwith being the electronic charge density whose expression is\n\n*Eq. 5\u201180* ,\n\n*Eq. 5\u201181* .\n\nIt should be especially noted here that to solve the Hartree-Fock\nequation , the most time consuming part is due to the nonlocal exchange\nterm, knowing the fact that the being evaluated one-electron wave\nfunction is also contained in the expression in the left hand side of by\nmeans of .\n\nThe configurational interaction method is the generalization of the\nHartree-Fock approximation.

This is to say, that for an\narbitrary the total energy of the system, *E*, is always larger or equal\nto a value, *E<sub>0</sub>*, called as the ground state energy:\n\n*Eq. 5\u201186* .\n\nIn terms of variational principle, is equivalent to\n\n*Eq. 5\u201187* .\n\nKohn and Sham \\[8\\] proposed to write the total energy as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201188* ,\n\nwhere represents the kinetic energy of the system, is the external\npotential acting on the system, is the Hartree energy, and is the\nso-called exchange-correlation energy with where and represent the\ncharge density of electrons with spin down and spin up, respectively .\nUsing\n\n*Eq. 5\u201189* ,\n\ntogether with the variational principle of , one can get the\none-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n*Eq. 5\u201190*\n\nwhere *m<sub>e</sub>* represents the mass of an electron and\n\n*Eq. 5\u201191*\n\nso that the total energy is obtained as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201192*\n\nThe major challenge within DFT is that the accurate formulation of the\nexchange-correlation energy is unknown. Except for the uniform electron\ngas, no exact analytical form for the exchange-correlation energy has\nyet been obtained. Therefore approximations must be made for the\nexchange-correlation energy in calculating a realistic system. Until\nnow, the two most popular approximations are the local density\napproximation (LDA) \\[30\\] and the generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA) \\[31-32\\].\n\nThe local density approximation (LDA) states that the\nexchange-correlation energy is the same as that for a locally uniform\nelectron gas. In this case one can write *V<sub>xc</sub>* as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201193* .\n\nAlthough this approximation is extremely simple, it works reasonably\nwell for many systems. The only remaining problem is to find an\napproximate solution to .

As the LDA\napproximates the energy of the true density by the energy of a local\nconstant density, it fails in situations where the density undergoes\nrapid changes such as in molecules. An improvement to this can be made\nby considering the gradient of the electron density. Symbolically, this\ncan be written as\n\n*Eq. 5\u201194*\n\nThe commonly used GGA is those due to Perdew et al. \\[31-32\\].\n",

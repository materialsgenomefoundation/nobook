However,\nexperimental data are not always available. This is due to the fact that\ni) the experiments are expensive, especially true in developing new\nmaterials; and ii) the experiments cannot reliably access the non-stable\nphases in most cases. The alternative approach is to predict the\nthermochemical data by first-principles calculations. The prediction of\nthe material properties, without using phenomenological parameters, is\nthe basic spirit of first-principles calculations. In particular, the\nsteady increase of both computer power and the efficiency of\ncomputational methods have made the first-principles predictions of most\nthermodynamic properties possible, including both enthalpy and entropy\nas a function of temperature, volume, and/or pressure.\n\nBy its definition, the term of \u201cfirst-principles\u201d represents a\nphilosophy that the prediction is to be based on a basic, fundamental\nproposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other\nproposition or assumption. This implies that the computational\nformulations are based on the most fundamental theory of quantum\nmechanics - Schr\u00f6dinger equation or density functional theory and the\ninputs to the calculations must be based on well-defined physical\nconstants \u2013 the nuclear and electronic charges. In another word, once\nthe atomic species of an assigned material are known, the theory should\npredict the energy of all possible crystalline structures, without\ninvoking any phenomenological fitting parameters.\n\nThis chapter organized in the sequence from thermodynamic calculations\nto fundamental theory to help those readers who are more interested in\nrealistic calculations using existing computer codes. The detailed\ntheoretical sections are presented to follow the section of\nthermodynamic calculations for those readers who are also interested in\nthe derivation of the formulations used in the thermodynamic\ncalculations. The following subsections are arranged accordingly in the\norder: (i) examples the commonly adopted calculation procedures for\nthermodynamic properties using the elemental metal nickel as the main\nprototype; (ii) derivation of the Helmholtz energy expression under the\nfirst-principles framework; (iii) introduction of the solution to the\nelectronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation within the two well developed frameworks\n\u2013 the quantum chemistry approach and the density functional theory; (iv)\ndetailed description of the procedure on how to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for the motions of the atomic nuclei by means of lattice\ndynamics. The relation between the Helmholtz energy and Gibbs energy is\nshown by .\n",

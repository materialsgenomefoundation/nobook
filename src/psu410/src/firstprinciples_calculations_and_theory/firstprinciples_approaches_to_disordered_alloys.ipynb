      "source": "## First-principles approaches to disordered alloys\n\nFirst-principles calcuations discussed so far strictly rely on the exact\natomic positions in the unit cells. A brutal-force approach for random\nsolution phase would be to directly construct a large supercell and\nrandomly decorate the host lattice with different types of atoms. Such\nan approach would necessarily require very large supercells to\nadequately mimic the statistics of the random solutions. Since\nfirst-principles methods are computationally constrained by the number\nof atoms that one can treat, this brute-force approach is\ncomputationally prohibitive. Take a binary\nA<sub>1-*x*</sub>B*<sub>x</sub>* substitutional alloy as illustrated in\nas an example, for a system containing *N* atoms, there can be\n2*<sup>N</sup>* possible number of configurations, which is an\nastronomically large number when *N* is large. It is an impossible task\nto explore such a huge configuration space with available computing\nresources.\n\nFigure \u2011. Mapping of a substitutional A<sub>1-x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> alloy\ninto an Ising-like lattice model \\[39-40\\].\n\nAs a result, approximations must be made to the first-principles\ncalculations. At present, there are mainly three approaches to\ncalculating the disordered solution phases: the coherent potential\napproximation (CPA) \\[41\\], the cluster expansion (CE) \\[42\\], and the\nspecial quasirandom structures (SQS\u2019s) \\[43\\] approach.\n\nCPA \\[41\\] treats random alloys by considering the *average* occupations\nof lattice sites in solving the Kohn-Sham equation. Since a mean-field\napproach is employed, dependence of properties on the local environments\nsurrounding an atom is not treated explicitly in CPA. In a random\nsolution, there exists a distribution of local environments (e.g., in\nbcc alloys, A or B surrounded by the various\nA*<sub>X</sub>*B<sub>8-*X*</sub> coordination shells with *X* between 0\nand 8), resulting in local environmentally-dependent quantities such as\ncharge transfer and local displacements of atoms from their ideal\nlattice positions. Even in random A<sub>1-*x*</sub>B*<sub>x</sub>* solid\nsolutions, the average A-A, A-B and B-B bond lengths are generally\ndifferent. These effects can be considered by the CE and SQS approaches,\nwhich are the focus of the next two subsections. In following\nsubsections, unless specifically noted, the formulism for the binary\nsystem is discussed for the sake of simplicity.\n",

      "source": "### Cluster Expansions\n\nMany properties of a solution phase such as energy are dependent on the\n*configurations* - the arrangements of atoms on the lattice sites. In\ncluster expansion \\[35, 42\\], the configuration dependence of properties\nis formulated efficiently by a \u201clattice algebra\u201d which maps a\nsubstitutional configuration into an Ising-like lattice model. Taking a\nbinary A<sub>1-*x*</sub>B*<sub>x</sub>* solution phase for instance, A\natoms are represented by the \u201cdown\u201d spins (*S<sub>i</sub>* = -1) and B\natoms are represented by the \u201cup\u201d spins (*S<sub>i</sub>* = +1) as\nillustrated in . Using the cluster expansion technique, for a system\ncontaining *N* atoms, the total energy of any alloy configuration *\u03c3* =\n(*S*<sub>1</sub>, *S*<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, *S<sub>N</sub>*) can be\nconveniently evaluated using the following Ising-like Hamiltonian:\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011147*\n\nwhere *J*\u2019s are the effective cluster interactions (ECI\u2019s); is a number\nrepresenting the atomic occupation at the lattice *i* under the\nconfiguration *\u03c3*, which takes the values -1 and 1 for binary and -1, 0,\nand 1 for ternary etc. In , the 2-site, 3-site, and 4-site correlations\nare written as follows,\n\nEq. 5\u2011148\n\nEq. 5\u2011149\n\nEq. 5\u2011150 .\n\nThe expansion in would be exact as long as *all* the *n*-site\ninteractions are included. For a binary system, this can be observed by\nthe combination law that where is the number of *n*-site interactions.\nHowever, in actual calculations, one never does an expansion to the\norder *N* (containing 2*<sup>N</sup>* terms for binary) since it is too\nlong to be practical. In fact, since the interactions between widely\nseparated atoms are expected to be weaker than the interactions between\nnearer atoms for most of the important properties, the expansion in is\nusually truncated at certain distance to include only a few short-ranged\npair (2-site), triple (3-site), and up to the most, the quadruple\n(4-site) interactions.\n\nOnce a configuration is assigned, the *S*\u2019s are just the geometrical\nfactors. The common practice in the cluster expansion is that i) perform\nfirst-principles calculations of a selected set of configurations\n(around 20-100); ii) evaluate the values of *J*\u2019s using with the\nenergies from i); iii) use the fitted *J*\u2019s to predict the energy for a\ndesired set of configurations; and iv) make the ensemble average at a\ngiven temperature for the energetics of the random alloys through Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n",

The correlation functions are\nclassified by their *n*-site component \u201cfigures\u201d *f* = (*n,m*), where\nthe index *n* is called vortex for pair, triple, and quadruple\ncorrelations (*n* = 2, 3, and 4); *m* measures the correlation distance.\n\nIn the SQS approach, a distribution of distinct local environments is\nmaintained and their average corresponds to the random alloy. Thus, a\nsingle DFT calculation of an SQS can give many important alloy\nproperties (e.g. equilibrium bond lengths, charge transfer, formation\nenthalpies, etc.) that depend on the existence of those distinct local\nenvironments. The SQS approach has been used extensively to study the\nformation enthalpies, bond length distributions, density of states, band\ngaps and optical properties in semiconductor alloys. It is noted that\nthe CE approach can treat short-range ordering efficiently, while it is\nnot clear how the SQS approach can be used to represent short-range\nordering.\n\nThe key quantities in the SQS approach are the *n*-site correlation\nfunctions. Specifically, the 2-site correlation function corresponding\nto the 2-site component \u201cfigures\u201d (2,*m*) is\n\nEq. 5\u2011151\n\nwhere represents the total number of possible pairs with correlation\ndistance (neighboring distance) *R<sub>ij</sub>* being equal to *m*.

The 4-site correlation function corresponding to the 4-site\ncomponent \u201cfigures\u201d (4,*m*) is\n\nEq. 5\u2011153 ,\n\nwhere represents the total number of all possible 4-site \u201cfigures\u201d with\ncorrelation distance (size and shape) *R<sub>ijkl</sub>* being equal to\n*m*.\n\nWith a given supercell size *N*, the essential task of the SQS approach\nis to search through all configurations that approach as close as\npossible to the correlation functions of the perfectly random (*R*)\nstructure and for the binary system it is\n\nEq. 5\u2011154 .\n\nDescribing random alloys by small unit-cell periodical structures surely\nintroduces erroneous correlations beyond a certain distance. However,\nsince interactions between nearest neighbors are generally more\nimportant than interactions between more distant neighbors, SQS\u2019s can be\nconstructed in such a way that they exactly reproduce the correlation\nfunctions of a random alloy between the first few nearest neighbors,\ndeferring errors due to periodicity to more distant neighbors. The\npractical procedure could be that to find the structures that match the\n2-site correlation functions up to a given neighboring distance, and\nthen add the conditions matching the high order correlation functions up\nto certain correlation distance.\n\nAppendix B is a collection of the SQS\u2019s with a variety of compositions\nfor binary fcc, bcc, hcp, and L1<sub>2</sub> structures, for ternary\nfcc, bcc, and B2 structures, and Perovskite in the cubic ABO<sub>3</sub>\nstructure.

      "source": "### Phonon calculations for SQS\n\nA somewhat more theoretically demanding application of the SQS approach\nis the calculation of the phonon dispersions of a random alloy.\nConsidering the fact that the size of an SQS cell in general is around\n8-32, phonon calculations based on SQS is doable, either using the SQS\ncell or its supercell, e.g., of it. However, one notes that while the\nphonon density of states can be calculated straightforwardly, the\ncalculations of the phonon dispersions run into a problem. That is,\nsince phonon calculation treats the SQS as primitive unit cell made of\nmore atoms than the primitive unit cell of the ideal lattice, the number\nof phonon dispersions derived from a regular phonon calculations is a\nlot greater than that measured for the random alloy. Say, one uses an\nSQS containing 16 atoms for an fcc solid solution, the regular phonon\ncalculations would produce phonon dispersions in comparison to that just\nthree phonon dispersions from measurement. By averaging over the force\nconstants of a SQS, the dynamical matrix can be calculated with respect\nto the wave vector space of the ideal lattice of the random alloys.\n\nOne consideration that must be taken into account is that the phonon\ndispersions measured from the inelastic neutron scattering experiments\nonly represent the averaged vibrations of the ideal lattice. For random\nalloys or phases with minor geometry distortion, it is suggested to\ncalculate the dynamical matrix by instead of *Eq. 5\u2011125* as (see \\[45\\])\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011155* ,\n\nwhere in the case of random alloy, represents the averaged atomic mass\nat the *j*th lattice site. The purpose of the summation over *Q* is to\naverage the effects of local distortions, making it possible of\ncomparing the calculated dispersions to the measured dispersions\nrepresenting the averaged vibrations of the ideal lattice. As a result,\nthe dimension of the SQS supercell dynamical matrix is thus reduced to\nmatch that of the primitive unit cell of the ideal lattice for the\ncalculation of the phonon frequencies. The calculational procedure is as\nfollows:\n\n1.  Make an SQS supercell based on the primitive unit cell of ideal\n    lattice to mimic the correlation functions of the random solution;\n\n2.  Relax the SQS supercell with respect to the internal atomic\n    positions while keeping the cell shape and volume fixed;\n\n3.  Make the phonon supercell by further enlarging the SQS supercell and\n    calculate the force constants; and\n\n4.  Calculate the dynamical matrix , with the wave vector, **q**, being\n    defined from the primitive unit cell of the ideal lattice, through\n    the following Fourier transformation.\n\nThe calculated phonon dispersions, along the directions (00\u03be), (0\u03be\u03be),\nand (\u03be\u03be\u03be), are compared with the inelastic neutron scattering data in\nfor Cu<sub>3</sub>Au.\n\nFigure 5\u201113. Phonon dispersions for random Cu<sub>3</sub>Au. The solid\n(black) lines represent the present calculation and the open circles\nrepresent the inelastic neutron scattering data with details in Ref.\n\\[45\\].

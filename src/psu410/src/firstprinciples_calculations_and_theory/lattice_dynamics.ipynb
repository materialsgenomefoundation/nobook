      "source": "### Linear-response method vs supercell method\n\nThe problem of lattice vibration for a solid is now transformed into\ncomputing the dynamical matrix in . The first-principles solution of the\nproblem is currently divided into two categories: the linear-response\nmethod \\[34\\] and the supercell method \\[35\\]. In the linear-response\nmethod, utilizing the electronic linear response upon the undistorted\ncrystals \\[36\\], the evaluations of the dynamical matrix can be\nperformed through the density-functional perturbation theory \\[34\\]\nwithout the approximation of the cutoff in neighboring interaction.\n\nCompared with the linear-response method, the supercell method is\nconceptually simple and is easy to implement computationally. The\nsupercell method adopts the frozen phonon approximation through which\nthe changes in total energy or forces are calculated in the direct space\nby displacing the atoms from their equilibrium positions. The advantage\nof the supercell method is that the phonon frequencies at the exact wave\nvectors, which are commensurable with the supercell, are calculated\nexactly with no further approximation \\[37\\]. The shortcoming of the\nsupercell method is that it is often limited by the size of the\nsupercell that can be handled with current computing resources.\n\nIn supercell approach, inaccuracies are thought to arise from the\ntruncation of the force constants \\[34-35\\]. This is only partially\ntrue. In the supercell method, the calculated represents the cumulative\ncontributions of the atom indexed by *k* and *P* in the supercell and\nall its images by translational transformation of the supercell in the\nwhole space. Let **L**<sub>\u03b1</sub> represent the lattice vectors of the\nsupercell, then\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011138* .\n\nFor the exact wave vectors in , one has\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011139* **,**\n\nwhere is an integer. Replacing in with in , one obtains\n\nEq. 5\u2011140 .\n\nTherefore, the phonon frequencies calculated at the exact wave vectors\nby the cumulative force constants approach are exact, and the supercell\nsize will not lead to errors in the calculated phonon frequencies\n\\[37\\].\n\nGenerally speaking, if a supercell contains *N<sub>c</sub>* primitive\nunit cells, one can always find *N<sub>c</sub>* corresponding exact wave\nvectors in the **q** space. In most linear response calculations, the\ncommon choice of a 4\u00d74\u00d74 **q**-mesh is exactly equivalent to the 4\u00d74\u00d74\nsupercell in the real-space. Furthermore, since the supercell approach\ndoes not impose any approximation on the electronic response to the\ndistortion of the lattice geometry, the effects of electron-phonon\ninteractions can be accounted for by the supercell method.\n\nIn the supercell method, due to the impose of periodic condition, the\ncalculated force constant in the real-space cannot account for the\neffects of the vibration-induced electric field for the polar materials.\nIt has been demonstrated that such an effect adds an additional term to\ndynamical matrix in the reciprocal-space in the form,\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011141* ,\n\nwhere ***Z**<sup>\\*</sup> (j)* represents the Born effective charge\ntensor of the *j*<sup>th</sup> atom in the primitive unit cell and\n**\u03b5<sub>\u221e</sub>** the high frequency static dielectric tensor, i.e., the\ncontribution to the dielectric permittivity tensor from the electronic\npolarization. As a result for the polar materials, the matrix element at\nwave vector **q**\u21920 of the dynamical matrix in , by means of , should\nhave the form\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011142* .\n\nIt can be demonstrated \\[38\\] that this is equivalent to replacing the\nreal space force constant in by\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011143* .\n\nThe present implementation of the first-principles method in calculating\nthe phonon frequencies are mostly limited by the supercell size when\nusing or the number of exact wave vector points when using . A supercell\ncell built on the primitive unit cell or exact wave vector mesh is\nusually the common limit. If only the phonon frequencies derived from or\nare used, can be rather unsmooth which will result in inaccurate\nthermodynamic properties when it is used with . The mixed-space approach\n\\[38\\] can circumvent this bottleneck by using the Fourier interpolation\nto calculate the dynamical matrix for an arbitrary wave vector **q** as\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011144* ,\n\nwith the help of , , and for a polar materials. Note that the term is\nfor polar materials only.\n\nThe can be calculated as\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011145* ,\n\nwhere the function is usually taken as the Gaussian type\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011146* ,\n\nwhere is an adjustable damping (broadening) parameter whose role is to\nsmear the curve. in is the number of used **q** points. Empirically, a\n**q** mesh of is accurate enough for most purposes and doable with the\nYPHON code \\[15\\] efficiently, which is discussed in the Appendix A.\n",

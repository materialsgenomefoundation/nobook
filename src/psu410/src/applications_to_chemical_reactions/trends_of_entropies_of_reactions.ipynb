The reason\nthis is true can be explained as follows.\n\nThe entropy of a substance can be thought of as being the sum of four\nparts: (i) translational, (ii) rotational, (iii) vibrational, and (iv)\nelectronic. The translational entropy of a gas is the largest entropy\nterm under most conditions. To the extent that the other contributions\ncancel between reactants and products, the entropy of reaction is\ndetermined by the change in the number of moles of gaseous molecules.\nBased on the literature data or calculations from the SSUB database, the\nnet change in the number of moles of gas in a reaction results\napproximately in an entropy of reaction of about 175\u00b145 J/K/mole-gas at\n298K for many halides and oxides. The chemical reactions of and\ndiscussed above both reduce the gas by one mole, and their entropies of\nreaction are -113 and -172 J/K at 1273K, and -89 and -173J/K at 298K,\nrespectively, indicating that the chemical reaction of is an exception\nof the empirical rule. For chemical reactions shown in the Ellingham\ndiagram, their entropies of reaction follow this empirical rule pretty\nwell with some of them shown in calculated from the SGTE database.\n\nTable \u2011: Entropies of reactions with gas at 298.15K, J/K\n\nReaction: Si+O<sub>2</sub> =SiO<sub>2</sub> -182\n\nReaction: Ti+O<sub>2</sub>=TiO<sub>2</sub> -185\n\nReaction: 2Mg+O<sub>2</sub>=2MgO -217\n\nReaction: 2Ca+O<sub>2</sub>=2CaO -212\n\nReaction: 2Mn+O<sub>2</sub>=2MnO -150\n\nSince the entropy of a reaction is primarily determined by the net\nchange in the number of moles of gas, the entropies for reactions\ninvolving only condensed phases must be small. The entropies of fusion\nof monatomic solids are usually in the range 8-15 J/K/mole-atom as shown\nfor some elements in . Most metals and many ionic salts have values that\nlie in this range when given in terms of per mole of atom of material.\nThere are few exceptions such as silicon and boron shown in the table.\nFor solid-state reactions, the average values can be approximated as\n0\u00b18J/K/mole-atom as also shown in the table.\n\nTable \u2011: Entropies of reactions of condensed phases at 298.15K, J/K\n\nReaction: Si(s)=Si(l) 29.762\n\nReaction: Ti(s2)=Ti(l) 7.288\n\nReaction: Mg(s2)=Mg(l) 9.184\n\nReaction: Ca(s2)=Ca(l) 7.659\n\nReaction: Mn(s2)=Mn(l) 11.443\n\nReaction: W(s)=W(l) 14.158\n\nReaction: B(s)=B(l) 21.380\n\nReaction: 3Fe+C=CFe<sub>3</sub> 17.060\n\nReaction: S+Mn=MnS 13.909\n\nReaction: NiO+Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>=Fe<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>4</sub>\n0.464\n",

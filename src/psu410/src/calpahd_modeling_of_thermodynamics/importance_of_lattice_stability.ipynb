However, the independent\ncomponent *i* may not be stable in the crystal structure of the phase\nunder consideration, so its Gibbs energy could not be obtained directly\nfrom experiments and must be estimated with respect to the Gibbs energy\nof their stable crystal structure. In the pioneering work by Kaufman\n\\[47\\], this Gibbs energy difference was termed as lattice stability and\nobtained through extrapolations in either temperature-pressure or\ntemperature-composition phase diagrams. It is evident from that the\nvalues of $_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}$ and $_{\\ }^{M}G$ jointly contribute to the\nGibbs energy of the solution, and Kaufman had to simplify the treatment\nof $_{\\ }^{M}G$ in order to show the importance of the concept of\nlattice stability. Using ideal or regular solution models, Kaufman was\nable to define the lattice stability for pure elements and remarkably\nreproduce many features of binary phase diagrams by introducing the\ninteraction parameters afterwards.\n\nOver the years, there had been various revisions of lattice stability\nvalues for common crystal structures \\[48\\], and every revision\nnecessitates the re-evaluation of interaction parameters in the solution\nphase shown in . It was until the lattice stability values established\nby the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) \\[52\\] that the\ndevelopment of binary thermodynamic models using the same thermodynamic\nmodels of pure elements became possible, and those binary models thus\ndeveloped in different groups around the world can be combined to create\nthermodynamic models of ternary and multi-component systems. Clearly,\nany further modifications of the SGTE pure element database will require\nthe re-modeling of all binary and ternary systems in which the models of\npure elements are changed. This challenge is briefly addressed in the\nlater part of this chapter.\n\nA less addressed issue is the Gibbs energy of end-members in\nnon-stoichiometric compounds, i.e. , where each sublattice contains only\none element. In case all sublattices are occupied by the same element,\nit is the lattice stability of the elements in the structure of the\ncompound. Since the stable composition ranges of non-stoichiometric\ncompounds are typically small, the existing method cannot be used to\nreliably evaluate the Gibbs energy of end-members, and currently there\nis not a commonly accepted lattice stability database for compounds.\nMost values used in the existing databases have been either roughly\nestimated or computed from first-principles calculations. Such a\nstandard database is highly desirable in order to make various models of\ncompounds compatible.\n\nIn an effort to compare the lattice stability from the CALPHAD models\nand the first-principles calculations, Wang et al. \\[53\\] systematically\ncalculated the total energies of 78 pure elements at zero Kelvin in the\nface-centered-cubic (fcc), body-centered-cubic (bcc), and\nhexagonal-close-packed (hcp) crystal structures using the projector\naugmented-wave (PAW) method within the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA). The calculated values are compared with the values\nin the SGTE database as shown in and . For non-transition metal\nelements, the differences between the SGTE data and the PAW-GGA data are\ntypically around 1\u223c2 kJ/mole-of-atoms or less, while for some transition\nmetal elements, the differences can be quite large, for example, as high\nas about 54 kJ/mole-of-atoms for and about 40 kJ/mole-of-atoms for . and\npresent the differences between the PAW-GGA data and the SGTE data, for\nelements from the Ti group to the Ni group, respectively.\n\nTable \u2011: Lattice stability E<sup>bcc-fcc</sup> (kJ/mole-of-atoms).\n\nTable \u2011: Lattice stability E<sup>hcp-fcc</sup> (kJ/mole-of-atoms).\n\nFigure \u2011: Lattice stability difference between bcc and fcc, , for\nselected elements between PAW-GGA and SGTE\n\nFigure \u2011: Lattice stability difference between hcp and fcc, , for\nselected elements between PAW-GGA and SGTE\n\nThe large differences between the first-principles calculations and the\nSGTE data could partly be attributed to the instability of the\nhigher-energy phases, the entropies of which at finite *T* become\nabnormal. The lattice instabilities along the tetragonal transformation\npath between fcc and bcc structures with the continuous change of the\nc/a ratio defined in a bcc-based tetragonal lattice are demonstrated for\nbcc Mo, Ta, W in and for fcc Al, Cu, Ni in . It is shown that the fcc\nstructure of bcc Mo, Ta, and W is a local maximum with respect to the\ntetragonal transformation, and the higher the maximum is, the larger the\ndiscrepancy between the SGTE data and the present PAW-GGA data, while\nfor fcc Al, Cu, Ni, the bcc structure is at a local maximum. Similarly,\nthe lattice instabilities along the tetragonal transformation path for\nthe hcp metals Ru and Os as shown in . The behavior of energy against\nc/a ratio of these two hcp metals is very similar to those of fcc\nelements.\n\nFigure \u2011: Total energy, , along the Bain deformation path between bcc\nand fcc for Mo, Ta, and W.\n\nFigure \u2011: Total energy, , along the tetragonal transformation path\nbetween bcc and fcc for Ni, Al, and Cu.\n\nFigure \u2011: Total energy, , along the tetragonal transformation path for\nRu and Os\n\nIt can be concluded that a fcc structure for elements with bcc being the\nground state or a bcc structure for elements with fcc being the ground\nstate, is unstable with respect to the tetragonal transformation. For an\nunstable structure, the harmonic description of its vibrational entropy\nis thermodynamically incorrect since the potential surface seen by the\nlattice ion can no longer be approximated by a parabola. If an unstable\nstructure of a pure element is stabilized at high temperatures, its\nentropy has to be abnormal. The instability issue has been recently\naddressed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at high\ntemperatures using W as an example \\[54\\], which is beyond the scope of\nthe book and thus not discussed here.\n",

Information on features of software tools for\nCALPHAD modeling can be found at two series of publications in the\nCALPHAD journal \\[50-51\\]. The key feature of the CALPHAD method is the\nmodeling of Gibbs energy of individual phases using both thermodynamic\nand phase equilibrium data. The main significances of the CALPHAD method\nare as follows\n\n1.  It enabled the development of the concept of lattice stability, i.e.\n    the energy difference of a pure element with stable and non-stable\n    crystal structures;\n\n2.  The Gibbs energy expression of each phase covers the full\n    temperature, pressure, and composition spaces including both stable\n    and non-stable regions of the phase. This enables the evaluation of\n    the Gibbs energy of a system as a function of non-equilibrium state,\n    i.e. with \u03be as an independent variable;\n\n3.  Thermodynamic data are usually obtained by measurements of heat such\n    as enthalpy of transition and heat capacity as discussed in Chapter\n    , which bear large uncertainties typically in the range of\n    kilojoules per mole-of-atom. On the other hand, phase equilibrium\n    data as discussed in Chapter , though more accurate, only contain\n    information on compositions of phases at equilibria, i.e., the\n    relative Gibbs energy of phases at equilibrium. The combination of\n    these two sets of data is foundational in CALPHAD modeling that\n    allows for accurate modeling of thermodynamic properties of\n    individual phases and reliable calculations of phase stability and\n    driving forces;\n\n4.  It provides a framework to model thermodynamic properties of\n    multi-component systems of industrial importance, enabling the\n    computational materials design. It has also been extended to model a\n    range of properties of individual phases in multi-component systems\n    such as diffusion coefficients, elastic coefficients, and thermal\n    expansion, supplying input data for computational simulations of\n    phase transformations during materials processing.\n\nIn this chapter, the basics of CALPHAD modeling of Gibbs energy of\nindividual phases are presented. For detailed implementations in various\nsoftware packages and modeling procedures, readers are referred to the\nreferences listed above.\n",

The Gibbs energy of end-members\nrepresented by plays the same important role for solution phases with\nsublattice as the lattice stability for random solution phases. The\nend-members are modeled in the same way as the stoichiometric phases\ndiscussed in Chapter . The enthalpy and entropy of mixing in each\nsublattice can be predicted by first-principles calculations using the\ndilute solution and SQS approaches discussed in Chapter and modeled in\nthe same way as the random solution discussed in Chapter .\n\nIt is important to realize that with a simple two-sublattice model of\n(A,B)<sub>a</sub>(C,D)<sub>b</sub>, the miscibility gap can easily form\neven without any interaction parameters when the Gibbs energy of\nend-members differ from each other significantly. The contribution of\nend-members to the Gibbs energy of the phase, i.e. , is re-written as\nfollows and schematically shown in ,\n\n*Eq. 6\u20118*\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic diagrams depicting (a) the concentration square with\nthe site fractions of B and D on the horizontal and vertical axes,\nrespectively, and (b) Gibbs energy reference plan for\n(A,B)<sub>a</sub>(C,D)<sub>b</sub>, as represented by .\n\nFrom b, it is evident that there is a strong tendency to form a\nmiscibility gap between the composition sets of\n(A)<sub>a</sub>(C)<sub>b</sub> and (B)<sub>a</sub>(D)<sub>b</sub> due to\ntheir lower Gibbs energies than the other two end-members. Since it\nwould be rare for all four end-members to have their Gibbs energy values\nequal, the miscibility gap in this type of phases is practically\ninevitable at low temperatures. An example is shown in for the complex\ntitanium niobium carbonitride (Ti,Nb)(C,N). The solid lines parallel to\nthe direction from NbC to TiN are tie-lines. The Gibbs energy values of\nTiC, TiN, NbC and NbN are -144495, -229236, -132324, and -179772\nJ/mole-of-atoms, respectively. The Gibbs energy value of TiN is\nsignificantly lower than the other values, resulting in the tie-lines\noriginating from the TiN corner.\n\nFigure \u2011: Miscibility gap in (Ti,Nb)(C,N) at 1673K with the straight\nlines in the middle of the plot being tie-lines.\n\nThe order-disorder transitions can be similarly described with the\nsimplest case being a two-sublattice model of\n(A,B)<sub>a</sub>(A,B)<sub>b</sub>. When the site fractions of A or B in\nboth sublattices are the same, it becomes a random solution model; when\nthey are different, the phase is partially ordered; and when there is\nonly one component in each sublattice, the phase is fully ordered as a\nstoichiometric compound. The Gibbs energy of this phase is obtained from\nas follows\n\n*Eq. 6\u20119*\n\n$G_{mf} = y_{A}^{I}y_{A}^{II}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} + y_{A}^{I}y_{B}^{II}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{A:B} + y_{B}^{I}y_{A}^{II}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:A} + y_{B}^{I}y_{B}^{II}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} + + aRT\\left( y_{A}^{I}\\ln y_{A}^{I} + y_{B}^{I}\\ln y_{B}^{I} \\right) + bRT\\left( y_{A}^{II}\\ln y_{A}^{II} + y_{B}^{II}\\ln y_{B}^{II} \\right) + y_{A}^{II}y_{A}^{I}y_{B}^{I}\\ L_{A,B:A} + y_{B}^{II}y_{A}^{I}y_{B}^{I}\\ L_{A,B:B} + y_{A}^{I}y_{A}^{II}y_{B}^{II}\\ L_{A:A,B} + y_{B}^{I}y_{A}^{II}y_{B}^{II}\\ L_{B:A,B} + y_{A}^{I}y_{B}^{I}\\ y_{A}^{II}y_{B}^{II}L_{A,B:A,B}$\n\nwhere the superscript denotes the sublattice, and column and comma\nseparate sublattices and interaction components, respectively. The\nrelationship between site fraction and over-all atomic fractions in such\na two-sublattice model can be represented by and schematically shown in\n. The two red dashed lines represent the phase with\n$x_{B} = \\frac{a}{a + b}$, but different a/b ratios. Along the red\ndashed lines, the phase can adjust the site fraction to minimize its\nGibbs energy, i.e. it has one internal degree of freedom to be either\ndisordered on the blue diagonal line between A:A and B:B, or ordered at\nanywhere else. The interplay of interaction parameters and site\nfractions is depicted where $L_{A,B:A}$, $L_{A,B:B}$, $L_{A:A,B}$, and\n$L_{B:A,B}$ affect the four sides, and $L_{A,B:A,B}$ influences the\ncenter part.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic composition square of\n(A,B)<sub>a</sub>(A,B)<sub>b</sub>.\n\nWhen fully disordered with $y_{A}^{I} = \\ y_{A}^{II} = x_{A}$ and\n$y_{B}^{I} = y_{B}^{II} = x_{B}$, becomes\n\n*Eq. 6\u201110*\n\n$$G_{mf} = x_{A}\\left( 1 - x_{B} \\right)_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} + x_{A}x_{B}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{A:B} + x_{A}x_{B}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:A} + x_{B}\\left( 1 - x_{A} \\right)\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} + + (a + b)RT\\left( x_{A}\\ln x_{A} + x_{B}\\ln x_{B} \\right) + \\ x_{A}x_{B}x_{A}L_{A,B:A} + x_{A}x_{B}x_{B}\\ L_{A,B:B} + x_{A}x_{B}x_{A}\\ L_{A:A,B} + x_{A}x_{B}x_{B}\\ L_{B:A,B} + x_{A}x_{A}x_{B}x_{B}L_{A,B:A,B} = x_{A}_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} + x_{B}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} + (a + b)RT\\left( x_{A}\\ln x_{A} + x_{B}\\ln x_{B} \\right) + x_{A}x_{B}\\left\\lbrack \\left(_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:B} +_{\\ }^{0}G_{B:A} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} \\right) + x_{A}\\left( L_{A,B:A} + L_{A:A,B} \\right) + x_{B}\\ \\left( L_{A,B:B} + L_{B:A,B} \\right) + x_{A}x_{B}L_{A,B:A,B} \\right\\rbrack = (a + b)\\left\\lbrack x_{A}_{\\ }^{0}G_{A} + x_{B}\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B} + RT\\left( x_{A}\\ln x_{A} + x_{B}\\ln x_{B} \\right) + x_{A}x_{B}L_{A,B} \\right\\rbrack$$\n\nwith\n\n*Eq. 6\u201111* $_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} = (a + b)_{\\ }^{0}G_{A}$\n\n*Eq. 6\u201112* $_{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} = (a + b)_{\\ }^{0}G_{B}$\n\n*Eq. 6\u201113*\n\n$$L_{A,B} = \\left\\lbrack \\left(_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:B} +_{\\ }^{0}G_{B:A} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{A:A} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{B:B} \\right) + x_{A}\\left( L_{A,B:A} + L_{A:A,B} \\right) + x_{B}\\ \\left( L_{A,B:B} + L_{B:A,B} \\right) + x_{A}x_{B}L_{A,B:A,B} \\right\\rbrack/(a + b)$$\n\nwhere $_{\\ }^{0}G_{A}$, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{B}$, and $L_{A,B}$ are the molar\nGibbs energy of pure A and B and the molar interaction parameter in the\ndisordered solid solution, respectively. It is evident that the\ninteratcation paramter $L_{A,B}$ is fully determined by the parameters\nin the ordered phase, but the parameters in the ordered phase are not\nuniquely determined by the interaction parameters in the disordered\nphase.\n\nDue to crystal symmetry, some of the parameters in are related. For\nexample, in the BCC A2/B2 ordering with a=b=0.5, the BCC corner or\ncenter lattice sites are favored by either one type of atoms, but the\ntwo sublattices are equivalent crystallographically, resulting in\nfollowing relations\n\n*Eq. 6\u201114* $\\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{A:B} = \\ _{\\ }^{0}G_{B:A}$\n\n*Eq. 6\u201115* $L_{A,B:A} = L_{A:A,B}$\n\n*Eq. 6\u201116* $L_{A,B:B} = \\ L_{B:A,B}$\n\nFor more complex ordering of BCC lattice such as B32, D0<sub>3</sub>,\nand L2<sub>1</sub> shown in with ideal compositions being AB,\nA<sub>3</sub>B, and A<sub>2</sub>BC, respectively, more sublattices are\nneeded, noting that the L2<sub>1</sub> Heusler structure exists in\nternary systems only. To use one model to describe all ordering in the\nBCC lattice, the minimum cluster is an irregular tetrahedron with four\nsublattices as depicted in as discussed in the modeling of the Al-Fe\nsystem \\[56\\]. In such a four sublattice model of\n$(A,B)_{0.25}^{I}(A,B)_{0.25}^{II}(A,B)_{0.25}^{II}(A,B)_{0.25}^{IV}$,\nthe site fractions of A2, B2, B32, and D0<sub>3</sub>, are represented\nby $y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} = y_{i}^{III} = \\ y_{i}^{IV}$,\n$y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} \\neq y_{i}^{III} = \\ y_{i}^{IV}$,\n$y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{III} \\neq y_{i}^{II} = \\ y_{i}^{IV}$, and\n$y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} \\neq y_{i}^{III} \\neq \\ y_{i}^{IV}$,\nrespectively. The site fractions of L2<sub>1</sub> are the same as those\nof D0<sub>3</sub> except with at least three components.\n\nFigure \u2011: Atomic structures and four sublattice tetrahedrons of BCC\ndisordered and ordered phases.\n\nAnother common ordering phenomenon is in the FCC lattice including the\ndisordered A1 structure and ordered L1<sub>0</sub> and L1<sub>2</sub>\nstructures as shown in . In the L1<sub>0</sub> structure, the\nneighboring (001) planes are favored by different atoms, respectively,\nresulting in an ideal composition of AB. While in the L1<sub>2</sub>\nstructure, the corners and faces are favored by different atoms,\nrespectively, resulting in an ideal composition of A<sub>3</sub>B. In a\nfour sublattice model of\n$(A,B)_{0.25}^{I}(A,B)_{0.25}^{II}(A,B)_{0.25}^{II}(A,B)_{0.25}^{IV}$,\nthe site fractions of A1, L1<sub>0</sub> and L1<sub>2</sub> are\nrepresented by $y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} = y_{i}^{III} = \\ y_{i}^{IV}$,\n$y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} \\neq y_{i}^{III} = \\ y_{i}^{IV}$, and\n$y_{i}^{I} = \\ y_{i}^{II} = y_{i}^{III} \\neq \\ y_{i}^{IV}$, respectively\n\\[57\\].\n\nFigure \u2011: Atomic structures and four sublattice tetrahedrons of FCC\ndisordered and ordered phases.\n\nAs mentioned above, the interaction parameters in each sublattice can be\npredicted by first-principles calculations using the dilute solution and\nSQS approaches when there is only one component in each of the remaining\nsublattices. For the interaction involving two components in two or more\nsublattices, i.e. $L_{A,B:A,B}$ in applicable to four sublattice models\n\\[58\\], the energetics from cluster expansion (CE) approach discussed in\nChapter can be used to evaluate the interaction parameters.\n",

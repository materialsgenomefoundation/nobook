In one\nexperiment, the enthalpy of solution of a single phase is measured in a\nparticular solvent. To convert this enthalpy of solution into enthalpy\nof formation of the phase, a thermodynamic cycle is setup for a chemical\nreaction to form this phase from either constitutive pure elements or\ncompounds. Therefore in another experiment, the enthalpy of solution of\nconstitutive pure elements or compounds is measured in the solvent as\nidentical as possible to that used in the first experiment. The\ndifference of the two enthalpies of solution thus gives the enthalpy of\nformation of the single phase from its constitutive elements or\ncompounds at the temperature of the samples before they are dropped into\nthe solvent, usually at room temperature.\n\nThe solvent can be aqueous solutions at ambient temperatures and\npressures or metallic/salt/oxide melts at high temperatures under either\nadiabatic or isoperibol conditions. The adiabatic calorimetry measures\nthe temperature change of the solvent and is usually more accurate than\nthe isoperibol calorimetry that measures the heat generated during the\ndissolution, though the adiabatic ones are with more complex\ninstruments. It is important that the choices of solvent and temperature\nensure the complete dissolution of all substances into the solvent to\nform a homogeneous solution. Furthermore, the effect of dilution and of\nchanges in solvent composition needs to be considered in the calculation\nof enthalpy of solution.\n\nA large number of solvents are used. For aqueous solvent, hydrofluoric\nacid or mixtures of HF and HCl are often used. For oxides, buffer-type\nsystems are typical such as lead and alkali borates and alkali\ntungstates/molybdates. For metallic phases, low melting metals such as\nSn, Bi, In, Pb, and Cd, sometimes Al and Cu, are used. Factors such as\nsolubility, dissolution kinetics, thermal history, stirring, heat flow,\nparticle size, and system size are to be optimized for accurate\nmeasurements. To enhance solution kinetics, the compound to be studied\ncan be mixed with another element or compound so that the mixture can\nform liquid in the solvent at higher reaction rate. In any case, it is\nimportant to calibrate the system with pure elements and compounds of\nknown enthalpy of formation.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

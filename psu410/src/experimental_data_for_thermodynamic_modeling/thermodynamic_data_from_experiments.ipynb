For thermochemical\nproperties as the main topic of the book, calorimetric, electrochemical,\nand vapor pressure methods are the primary techniques used with the\nfirst for accurate measurement of enthalpy and entropy, and the latter\ntwo for direct determination of Gibbs energy and activity. The\nelectrochemical method is discussed in Chapter . The calorimetric method\nis divided into solution, combustion, direct reaction, and heat capacity\ncalorimetry, respectively, which all involve chemical reactions to be\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter . The vapor pressure method involves the\nequilibrium of volatile species between gas and samples and is divided\ninto Knudsen effusion and equilibration methods, respectively.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "417cc01d", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Vapor pressure method\n\nIn the Knudsen effusion method, a small amount of volatile species in\nthe gas phase effuses through a small orifice of 0.1 to 1 mm with\nnegligible influence of the equilibrium in the Knudsen cell. The vapor\nis ionized and analyzed with a mass spectrometer. The partial pressure\nof a species can be calculated from its ionization area and intensity\nthrough a calibration factor determined by a reference material with\nknown partial pressure. For high temperature measurements, care must be\ntaken to avoid the reactions between cell and sample and fragmentation\nof gas species on ionization. The typical vapor pressure range is\nbetween 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10 Pa.\n\nIn various equilibration methods, the total vapor pressure is usually\nmeasured directly using pressure gauges in the range of 10<sup>-7</sup>\nand 100 kPa. Other direct or indirect methods include\n\nthermogravimetric method for measuring the vapor mass\n\natomic absorption spectroscopy for gas composition\n\nmeasurement of sample composition equilibrated with a gas of\nwell-defined activity of the volatile species\n\nthe dew point method in which the condensation temperature of the\nvolatile component is measured from the vapor equilibrated with the\nsample at a higher temperature,\n\nthe chemical transport method to be discussed in Chapter .\n\nThe main error in all these methods is often due to inadequate\nequilibration between vapor and sample.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

Experimental data include\nboth thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data, while the\nfirst-principles calculations, which only provide thermodynamic data of\nindividual phases, are discussed more extensively in Chapter .\n\nThe three recently published books summarize the commonly used methods\non experimental measurements of thermodynamic properties of single \\[9\\]\nand multiple phases \\[10\\] and phase diagrams \\[11\\]. They are briefly\ndiscussed here, and readers are referred to these books for details. The\nmain techniques for crystal structure analysis include X-ray\ndiffraction, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), electron\ndiffraction in transmission electron microscopy, neutral scattering, and\nsynchrotron scattering, which are not discussed in this book.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

The essential step in lattice\ndynamics is to transform the problem of the correlated motions of 3*N*\nparticle into the problem of 3*N* independent harmonics.

However, one notes that while the\nphonon density of states can be calculated straightforwardly, the\ncalculations of the phonon dispersions run into a problem. That is,\nsince phonon calculation treats the SQS as primitive unit cell made of\nmore atoms than the primitive unit cell of the ideal lattice, the number\nof phonon dispersions derived from a regular phonon calculations is a\nlot greater than that measured for the random alloy. Say, one uses an\nSQS containing 16 atoms for an fcc solid solution, the regular phonon\ncalculations would produce phonon dispersions in comparison to that just\nthree phonon dispersions from measurement. By averaging over the force\nconstants of a SQS, the dynamical matrix can be calculated with respect\nto the wave vector space of the ideal lattice of the random alloys.\n\nOne consideration that must be taken into account is that the phonon\ndispersions measured from the inelastic neutron scattering experiments\nonly represent the averaged vibrations of the ideal lattice. For random\nalloys or phases with minor geometry distortion, it is suggested to\ncalculate the dynamical matrix by instead of *Eq. 5\u2011125* as (see \\[45\\])\n\n*Eq. 5\u2011155* ,\n\nwhere in the case of random alloy, represents the averaged atomic mass\nat the *j*th lattice site.

As a result,\nthe dimension of the SQS supercell dynamical matrix is thus reduced to\nmatch that of the primitive unit cell of the ideal lattice for the\ncalculation of the phonon frequencies. The calculational procedure is as\nfollows:\n\n1.  Make an SQS supercell based on the primitive unit cell of ideal\n    lattice to mimic the correlation functions of the random solution;\n\n2.  Relax the SQS supercell with respect to the internal atomic\n    positions while keeping the cell shape and volume fixed;\n\n3.  Make the phonon supercell by further enlarging the SQS supercell and\n    calculate the force constants; and\n\n4.

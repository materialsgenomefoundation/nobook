A brutal-force approach for random\nsolution phase would be to directly construct a large supercell and\nrandomly decorate the host lattice with different types of atoms. Such\nan approach would necessarily require very large supercells to\nadequately mimic the statistics of the random solutions. Since\nfirst-principles methods are computationally constrained by the number\nof atoms that one can treat, this brute-force approach is\ncomputationally prohibitive. Take a binary\nA<sub>1-*x*</sub>B*<sub>x</sub>* substitutional alloy as illustrated in\nas an example, for a system containing *N* atoms, there can be\n2*<sup>N</sup>* possible number of configurations, which is an\nastronomically large number when *N* is large. It is an impossible task\nto explore such a huge configuration space with available computing\nresources.\n\nFigure \u2011. Mapping of a substitutional A<sub>1-x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> alloy\ninto an Ising-like lattice model \\[39-40\\].\n\nAs a result, approximations must be made to the first-principles\ncalculations. At present, there are mainly three approaches to\ncalculating the disordered solution phases: the coherent potential\napproximation (CPA) \\[41\\], the cluster expansion (CE) \\[42\\], and the\nspecial quasirandom structures (SQS\u2019s) \\[43\\] approach.\n\nCPA \\[41\\] treats random alloys by considering the *average* occupations\nof lattice sites in solving the Kohn-Sham equation. Since a mean-field\napproach is employed, dependence of properties on the local environments\nsurrounding an atom is not treated explicitly in CPA. In a random\nsolution, there exists a distribution of local environments (e.g., in\nbcc alloys, A or B surrounded by the various\nA*<sub>X</sub>*B<sub>8-*X*</sub> coordination shells with *X* between 0\nand 8), resulting in local environmentally-dependent quantities such as\ncharge transfer and local displacements of atoms from their ideal\nlattice positions. Even in random A<sub>1-*x*</sub>B*<sub>x</sub>* solid\nsolutions, the average A-A, A-B and B-B bond lengths are generally\ndifferent. These effects can be considered by the CE and SQS approaches,\nwhich are the focus of the next two subsections. In following\nsubsections, unless specifically noted, the formulism for the binary\nsystem is discussed for the sake of simplicity.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

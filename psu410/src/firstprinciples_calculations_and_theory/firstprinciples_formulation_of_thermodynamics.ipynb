Here,\nthe terminology microstate refers to the microscopic structure that is\ndistinguished by crystal structure, atom distributions in the lattice\nsites, and the arrangements of the local atomic spin and electronic\nangular momentum distributions among the lattice sites. From this\nsection on, the index \u03c3 is employed to label the microstate. For a solid\nmaterial at finite temperatures, a phase can be formed by a single\nmicrostate or a mixture of multiple microstates.\n\nLet us consider a canonical system made of *N* atoms with an average\natomic volume *V*. The study is limited to the motions of atomic nuclei\nand electrons. For such a system, one can use to index the energy\neigenvalues of the corresponding microscopic Hamiltonian associated with\nmicrostate *\u03c3*. The subscript **g** symbolically labels the different\nvibrational states for the motions of atomic nuclei and the subscript\n**n** symbolically labels the electronic states distinguished by the\ndifferent distributions of the electrons between the electronic valence\nand conduction bands.

All the thermodynamic quantities are calculated using\nformulations derived from the statistical physics without further\napproximation. The great importance of the phonon theory is that all the\ninput parameters can be obtained by means of first-principles\ncalculations without using any phenomenological parameters.\n\nLet us consider a system with an averaged atomic volume *V*. Neglecting\nthe electron phonon coupling, it is a well demonstrated procedure \\[16\\]\nto decompose the Helmholtz energy *F*(*V*,*T*) of the system at\ntemperature *T* into three additive contributions as follows\n\n*Eq. 5\u20111* ,\n\nwhere *E<sub>c</sub>* is the static total energy which is the total\nenergy of the system at 0 K without any atomic vibrations,\n*F<sub>vib</sub>* is the vibrational contribution due to the lattice\nions, and *F<sub>el</sub>* is the electronic contribution due to the\nthermal electronic excitation at finite temperature which can become\nimportant for metals at high temperature.\n\nThe terminology of \u201cquasiharmonic approximation\u201d arises from the fact\nthat for a given volume, *F<sub>vib</sub>*(*V*,*T*) is calculated under\nthe harmonic approximation and the anharmonic effects are carried out\nsolely through volume dependence of the phonon frequency. The easiest\ncomputational implementation of is to first independently calculate the\nHelmholtz energy at several selected volumes near the equilibrium volume\nand then use the numerical interpolation to find the Helmholtz energy at\nan arbitrary volume. The volume interval is usually at the scale of 3~5%\nof the equilibrium volume. Too small volume interval can result in\nnumerical instability due to the numerical uncertainties in the static\ntotal energy calculation, in particular, when one numerically computes\nthe first- and especially the second-order derivatives of the Helmholtz\nenergy in deriving the thermodynamic quantities. It should be noted that\nwhenever available, analytic formulas should be used instead of the\nnumerical second-order derivative to avoid numerical errors. For\ninstance, when the phonon approach is employed, the constant volume heat\ncapacity has the analytic expression in terms of phonon density of\nstates.\n\nNickel metal adopts the fcc structure at ambient conditions and the\nprimitive unit cell contains one atom. Almost all the existing\nfirst-principles codes have the function to calculate the static total\nenergy. The static total energy *E<sub>c</sub>* in should be calculated\nusing the primitive unit cell. As the Helmholtz energy is to be\ncalculated at several volumes, a good practice is to plot the calculated\nstatic total energy points together with the interpolated energy curve\nto examine the convergence of the static total energy calculation. Since\nthe first-principles method often employs the self-consistent technique,\nit could occur that calculations at certain volumes may not convergent,\nwhich should be fixed by trying the various algebraic schemes provided\nin most of the existing codes. Furthermore, since certain calculations\ninvolve the second order derivative of the Helmholtz energy, a minor\nuncertainty along the static total energy curve can result in large\ndeviation for the calculated properties such as thermal expansion\ncoefficient and bulk modulus. In that case, a reasonable solution is to\nsmoothen the static total energy using the modified Birch-Murnaghan\nequation of states (EOS) \\[17-18\\]\n\n*Eq. 5\u20112* .\n\nPlotted in is the calculated static total energy of the elemental metal\nNi with the circles representing the calculated values and the curve\nrepresenting that by EOS fitting.\n\nFigure \u2011. Static total energy of nickel.\n\nThe vibrational contribution to the Helmholtz energy by phonon theory\ncan be computed by \\[19\\]\n\n*Eq. 5\u20113* ,\n\nwhere is the Boltzmann\u2019s constant, *\u03c9* represents the phonon frequency,\nand is the phonon density of states. It is recommended that is\ncalculated at the same volume set at which the static total static\nenergies are calculated.\n\nFor the present prototype of Ni, the supercell method for the\ncalculation of has been employed. The procedure is follows:\n\n1.

The\n    > detailed formulation for phonon calculations is given in Chapter .\n\nFor the phonon calculations, one can use the open source code YPHON\n\\[15\\] by the present authors. Other choices can be the free ATAT code\n\\[20\\] or the free PHON code \\[21\\].

Phonon density of states of nickel.\n\nFor a first-principles thermodynamic calculation, an important step to\navoid possible calculation errors is to examine the phonon dispersions\nfirst. Phonon dispersion \\[23\\] depicts the evolution of phonon\nfrequencies along the designated direction for a crystal. Phonon\ndispersion can be measured rather accurately by inelastic neutron\nscattering \\[24-26\\] or inelastic x-ray scattering \\[27\\] experiment.\nPlotted in are the calculated phonon dispersions (curves) along the\n\\[00\u03b6\\], \\[0\u03b61\\], \\[0\u03b6\u03b6\\], and \\[\u03b6\u03b6\u03b6\\] directions of Ni using YPHON code\ncompared with the neutron scattering data at 296 K (symbols) with\ndetails in Ref. \\[16\\].\n\nFigure \u2011.

The electronic density\nof states can be obtained during the step of the static total energy\ncalculation. The detailed formulations for and *S<sub>el</sub>* are\ngiven in Chapter . Since Ni is magnetic, the EDOS of Ni can be\npartitioned into those of spin up and spin down due to the spin freedom\nof electron. The calculated EDOS for Ni is shown in where the solid,\ndot-dashed, and dashed lines represent the total, spin up, and spin down\nEDOS with the Fermi energy set to zero.\n\nFigure \u2011.

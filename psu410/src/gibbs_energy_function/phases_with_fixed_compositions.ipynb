A phase with a fixed\ncomposition can be a pure element or a stoichiometric compound. There is\nthus only one independent component in the system. A stoichiometric\ncompound contains more than one element, but the relative amounts of\neach element are fixed by the stoichiometry and cannot vary\nindependently, i.e., $dN_{i} = x_{i}dN$. The combined law of\nthermodynamics becomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dG = - SdT - Vd( - P) + \\left( \\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}\\mu_{i}} \\right)dN - Dd\\xi = - SdT - Vd( - P) + G_{m}dN - Dd\\xi$\n\n$G_{m}$ is the molar Gibbs energy of the stoichiometric compound and can\nbe regarded as the chemical potential of the stoichiometric\nphase,$\\ \\alpha$,\n\nEq. \u2011 $G_{m} = \\mu^{\\alpha} = \\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}\\mu_{i}}$\n\nThe chemical potential of individual components in the phase cannot be\ndefined because the amount of each component cannot be varied\nindependently. For a stoichiometric phase of $N$ moles of atoms at\nequilibrium with $dG$=$Nd\\mu^{\\alpha} + \\mu^{\\alpha}dN$, reduces to\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\ 0 = - SdT - Vd( - P) - Nd\\mu^{\\alpha}$\n\nwhich is the Gibbs-Duhem equation, , applied to a stoichiometric phase.\nIt can be represented graphically by a surface in a three-dimensional\nspace composed of $\\ \\mu^{\\alpha}$, *T* and *\u2013P*. The direction of the\nsurface is represented by the three partial directives between any two\nof $\\ \\mu^{\\alpha}$, *T* and *\u2013P* with the third one kept constant, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\ \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu^{\\alpha}}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = - \\frac{S}{N} = - S_{m}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\ \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu^{\\alpha}}{\\partial( - P)} \\right)_{T} = - \\frac{V}{N} = - V_{m}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\ \\left( \\frac{\\partial( - P)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\mu^{\\alpha}} = - \\frac{S}{V} = - \\frac{S_{m}}{V_{m}}$\n\nBased on Nernst\u2019s heat theorem, the entropy difference between two\ncrystals approaches zero when the temperature approaches absolute zero.\nIt is thus a common practice to put $S = 0$ for a crystal at 0 K. This\nis usually referred as the third law of thermodynamics. From the\ndefinition of entropy change by , $S$ or $S_{m}$ is always positive at\nfinite temperatures as the system or the crystal absorbs heat from the\nsurroundings to increase its temperature. $V$ or $V_{m}$ of a phase is a\nwell-defined physical quantity, and its absolute value can be given and\nis always positive. The above three equations can be written in a\ngeneral form as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\ \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} = - \\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}} < 0$\n\nThe surface thus has negative slopes in all its directions. The\ncurvature of the surface can be derived from\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}Y_{i}}{\\partial\\left( Y_{j} \\right)^{2}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} = - \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\left( \\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}} \\right)}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} = - \\frac{1}{X_{i}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{j}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} + \\frac{X_{j}}{\\left( X_{i} \\right)^{2}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} = - \\frac{1}{X_{i}}\\left\\lbrack \\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{j}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} - \\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial Y_{i}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)}_{Y_{k}} \\right\\rbrack = - \\frac{1}{X_{i}}\\left\\lbrack \\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{j}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} + \\left( \\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}} \\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial Y_{i}} \\right)_{Y_{k}} \\right\\rbrack < 0$\n\nBoth terms inside the last bracket are positive for a system in a state\nof stable internal equilibrium, and the surface thus has a negative\ncurvature and is convex everywhere as shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Gibbs energy of a one-component phase as a function of\ntemperature and negative pressure, showing the convex shape\n\nFrom experimental observations, it is known that\n$S_{m}^{vapor} \\gg S_{m}^{liquid} > S_{m}^{solid}$. The curves of\n$G_{m}$ or $\\mu^{\\alpha}$ plotted with respect to $T$ at constant $P$\nwould thus have the most negative slope for a vapour phase followed by\nits liquid and solid phases. As an example, shows Gibbs energy of Zn in\nits solid, liquid, and vapour forms as a function of $T$ at constant\n$P = 1$ atmospheric pressure.\n\nFigure \u2011: Molar Gibbs energy of Zn as a function of T at constant P\n\nSimilarly it is common that\n$V_{m}^{vapor} \\gg V_{m}^{liquid} > V_{m}^{solid}$, and the curves of\n$G_{m}$ or $\\mu^{\\alpha}$ plotted with respect to $P$ at constant $T$\nwould thus have the most positive slope for a vapour phase followed by\nits liquid and solid phases, though there are cases that\n$V_{m}^{liquid} < V_{m}^{solid}$ such as those of water and ice. As an\nexample, shows Gibbs energy of Fe in its two solid (fcc and bcc),\nliquid, and vapour forms as a function of $P$ at constant $T = 1273K$.\n\nFigure \u2011: Molar Gibbs energy of Zn as a function of P at constant T\n\nThe quantities measurable by experiments typically include temperature,\npressure, volume, composition, and amount of heat flow in the combined\nlaw of thermodynamics discussed so far. By measuring the heat needed to\nincrease the temperature of a phase, the heat capacity of the phase is\nobtained as shown by Eq. 2\u20117. A typical heat capacity curve as a\nfunction of temperature is shown in for fcc-Al, hcp-Mg, and an\nintermetallic phase Al<sub>12</sub>Mg<sub>17</sub>.\n\nFigure \u2011: Heat capacity of fcc-Al, hcp-Mg, and\nAl<sub>12</sub>Mg<sub>17</sub> as a function of temperature\n\nThere are various theoretical models for the heat capacity under\nconstant volume to be discussed in Chapter 5 of this book, which is\ndefined as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$C_{V} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T} \\right)_{V} = T\\left( \\frac{\\partial(F + TS)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{V} = T\\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} \\right)_{V} = - T\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial T^{2}} \\right)_{V}$\n\nTo establish the relationship between $C_{P}$ defined by and $C_{V}$,\n$U$ needs to be represented as a function of $T$ and $V$ in terms of $G$\nand its derivatives with respect to Gibbs energy\u2019s natural variables of\n$T$ and $P$. It can be done as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dV = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}dT + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial( - P)}d( - P) = - \\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)}dT - \\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}d( - P)$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = \\frac{\\partial(G + TS - PV)}{\\partial T}dT + \\frac{\\partial(G + TS - PV)}{\\partial( - P)}d( - P) = - \\left( T\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T^{2}} - P\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)} \\right)dT\u2014\\left( T\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)} + P\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}} \\right)\\left( - \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}}dV + \\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)}}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}}dT \\right) = - \\left\\lbrack T\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T^{2}} - T\\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)} \\right)^{2}}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}} \\right\\rbrack dT + \\left( - T\\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)}}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}} + P \\right)dV$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$C_{V} = C_{P} + T\\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T( - P)} \\right)^{2}}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}} = C_{P} - \\frac{\\alpha_{V}^{2}VT}{\\kappa_{T}} = C_{P} - \\alpha_{V}^{2}BVT$\n\nwhere the thermal expansion, $\\alpha_{V}$, and the compressibility or\nbulk modulus, $\\kappa_{T}$ or $B$, are defined by and , respectively.\nFrom the heat capacity, the enthalpy and entropy can be obtained by\nintegration of at a constant pressure\n\nEq. \u2011\n$S = S_{0} + \\int_{0}^{T}\\frac{C_{P}}{T}dT = S_{0} + \\int_{0}^{298.15}\\frac{C_{P}}{T}dT + \\int_{298.15}^{T}\\frac{C_{P}}{T}dT = S_{298.15} + \\int_{298.15}^{T}\\frac{C_{P}}{T}dT$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$H = H_{0} + \\int_{0}^{T}C_{P}dT = H_{0} + \\int_{0}^{298.15}C_{P}dT + \\int_{298.15}^{T}C_{P}dT = H_{298.15} + \\int_{298.15}^{T}C_{P}dT$\n\nIn the above equations, two temperature ranges of integration are chosen\nfor practical applications as most processing procedures in the field of\nmaterials science and engineering take place at temperatures above the\nroom temperature. Based on the third-law of thermodynamics, $S_{0} = 0$,\n$S_{298.15}$ can be obtained by integration. On the other hand for\n$H_{0} = U_{0} + PV$, one does not know the absolute value of the\ninternal energy and thus have to select a reference state for $H$. In\nprinciple, the reference state can be arbitrarily chosen. A widely used\nreference state in the thermodynamic modeling practice is to set\n$H_{298.15}^{SER} = 0$ at ambient pressure for pure elements at their\nrespective stable structures at room temperature, called stable element\nreference (SER) state with\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{298.15}^{SER} = H_{298.15}^{SER} - TS_{298.15}^{SER} = - TS_{298.15}^{SER}$\n\nIt is further noted that after defining $S_{298.15}$ and $H_{298.15}$,\none only needs the heat capacity at higher temperatures. This makes the\nmathematical representation of heat capacity simpler due to a relatively\nsimple temperature dependence of heat capacity at higher temperatures in\ncomparison with the variation at lower temperatures. One common\nexpression for heat capacity at high temperatures and ambient pressure\nis as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $C_{P} = c + dT + \\frac{e}{T^{2}} + fT^{2}$\n\nwhere c, d, e, and f are parameters fitted to experimental or theoretic\ndata and compiled in various handbooks.\n\nThe corresponding $S$, $H$, and $G$ are obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011 $S = b^{'} + clnT + dT - \\frac{e}{{2T}^{2}} + \\frac{f}{2}T^{2}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $H = a + cT + \\frac{d}{2}T^{2} - \\frac{e}{T} + \\frac{f}{3}T^{3}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G = H - TS = a - bT - cTlnT - \\frac{d}{2}T^{2} - \\frac{e}{2T} - \\frac{f}{6}T^{3}$\n\nwith $b = b^{'} - c$. The integration constants $b^{'}$ and $a$ are\nevaluated from $S_{298.15}$ and $H_{298.15}$. As an example, the\nenthalpy and entropy of Zn in solid (hcp), liquid, and gas forms are\nplotted in and , respectively. The distances between any two curves in\nand represent the enthalpy or entropy differences between the two\nphases. It can be seen that the gas has much higher enthalpy and entropy\nthan the solid and liquid.\n\nFigure \u2011: Enthalpy of Zn as a function of temperature at one atmospheric\npressure\n\nFigure \u2011: Entropy of Zn as a function of temperature at one atmospheric\npressure\n\nSimilarly, one can add the pressure dependence into the Gibbs energy\nfunction such as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G = a - bT - cTlnT - \\frac{d}{2}T^{2} - \\frac{e}{2T} - \\frac{f}{6}T^{3} + gP + hTP + mP^{2}$\n\nwhere g, h, and m are parameters fitted to experimental or theoretic\ndata and compiled in various handbooks.\n\nThe expression for $V$ can be derived as\n\nEq. \u2011 $V = g + hT + 2mP$\n\nThe Helmholtz energy can be expressed as a function of its natural\nvariables by solving $P\\ $ from\n\nEq. \u2011\n$F = G - PV = a - bT - cTlnT - \\frac{d}{2}T^{2} - \\frac{e}{2T} - \\frac{f}{6}T^{3} - \\frac{(g + hT - V)^{2}}{4m}$\n\nIn the literature there are many models to represent the temperature and\npressure dependences of thermodynamic properties. The Gibbs energy\ndifference between a stoichiometric compound and the components at their\nreference states of which the compound is composed,\n${_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{ref}$, is termed as Gibbs energy of formation, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}G = G - \\sum_{}^{}N_{i}{_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{ref}$\n\nwith $N_{i}$ being the stoichiometry of the compound. Similarly,\nenthalpy of formation, entropy of formation, and heat capacity of\nformation with respect to components at their reference states,\n$_{\\ }^{0}H_{i}^{ref}$, $_{\\ }^{0}S_{i}^{ref}$, and\n$_{\\ }^{0}{C_{P}}_{i}^{ref}$, can be defined as\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}H = H - \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}_{\\ }^{0}H_{i}^{ref}}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}S = S - \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}_{\\ }^{0}S_{i}^{ref}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}C_{P} = C_{P} - \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}_{\\ }^{0}{C_{P}}_{i}^{ref}}$\n\nIt should be mentioned that one mole of a compound usually refers to one\nmole of formula of stoichiometry of the compound. With a formula like\n$A_{a}B_{b}C_{c}$, the compound is composed of total $(a + b + c)$ moles\nof components. One should thus be very careful when dealing with\nnumerical values to be sure whether the data is in terms of per mole of\nformula or per mole of components. At the same time the reference states\nmust be clearly defined. When the SER state defined in is selected as\nthe reference state, the above formation quantities are called standard\nformation quantities such as standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nSince there are only two independent potentials in a one-component\nsystem, its limit of stability can be evaluated with one potential kept\nconstant, i.e. either $T$ or $P$. Consequently, either Helmholtz energy\nor enthalpy is to be used in deriving the limit of stability of a\nhomogeneous system. For the practical usefulness, let us use Helmholtz\nenergy because its natural variables of $T$ and *V* are measurable\nquantities in typical experiments, while one of the natural variables of\nenthalpy, entropy, is not. From and , the limit of stability for a\none-component system at constant temperature can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial( - P)}{\\partial V} \\right)_{T,N} = F_{VV} = \\frac{1}{V\\kappa_{T}} = \\frac{B}{V} = 0$\n\nwhere the isothermal compressibility and bulk modulus, $\\kappa_{T}$ and\n$B$, are defined in . The limit of stability is thus determined when the\nisothermal compressibility diverges or the bulk modulus becomes zero\nbecause $V$ has finite values at any temperatures. It is evident that\nHelmholtz energy must have higher order dependence on volume than in for\na system with instability because $F_{VV}$ from is constant.\n\nFrom , the consolute point is defined by\n\nEq. \u2011\n$F_{VVV} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}( - P)}{\\partial V^{2}} \\right)_{T,N} = \\frac{\\partial\\left( \\frac{1}{V\\kappa_{T}} \\right)}{\\partial V} = - \\frac{1 + \\frac{V}{\\kappa_{T}}\\frac{\\partial\\kappa_{T}}{\\partial V}}{\\kappa_{T}V^{2}} = 0$\n\nSince $\\kappa_{T}$ becomes infinite at the limit of stability,\n$\\frac{\\partial\\kappa_{T}}{\\partial V}$ approaches negative infinite\nwhen the critical/consolute point is approached so that\n$\\frac{V}{\\kappa_{T}}\\frac{\\partial\\kappa_{T}}{\\partial V} = - 1$ and\n$F_{VVV} = 0$.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

In typical\nmaterials-related experiments, temperature and pressure are the two\nvariables controlled. They are also the natural variables of Gibbs\nenergy. Consequently, Gibbs energy is the most widely used function in\nthermodynamics of materials science. The rest of this book focuses on\nGibbs energy for this reason. In this chapter, the mathematical formulas\nfor Gibbs energy of phases with fixed and variable compositions are\ndiscussed which are needed for quantitative calculations of Gibbs energy\nunder given values of its natural variables.\n\nFrom , the molar Gibbs energy can be defined as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m}\\left( T,P,x_{i},\\xi \\right) = \\frac{G}{N} = \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}x_{i}$\n\nThe molar entropy, molar volume, chemical potential, and the driving\nforce can be obtained from as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$S_{m} = \\frac{S}{N} = - \\frac{1}{N}\\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P,\\ N_{i},\\ \\xi} = {- \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial T} \\right)}_{P,\\ x_{i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$V_{m} = \\frac{V}{N} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P} \\right)_{T,\\ N_{i},\\ \\xi} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial P} \\right)_{T,\\ x_{i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{j \\neq i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$- D = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial\\xi} \\right)_{T,P,N_{i}\\ }$\n\nBased on , the molar enthalpy is written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $H_{m} = G_{m} + TS_{m}$\n\nOther physical properties of the system can also be represented by the\npartial derivatives of Gibbs energy such as heat capacity, $C_{P}$,\nvolume thermal expansivity, $\\alpha_{V}$, isothermal compressibility,\n$\\kappa_{T}$, as follows under constant pressure or temperature\n\nEq. \u2011\n$C_{P} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = T\\left( \\frac{\\partial(G + TS)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = T\\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = - T\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T^{2}} \\right)_{P}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\alpha_{V} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P}}{V} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P}}{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial T\\partial( - P)}}{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\kappa_{T} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial( - P)} \\right)_{T}}{V} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}}{\\partial( - P)} \\right)_{T}}{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2}G}{\\partial( - P)^{2}}}{\\left( \\partial G/\\partial( - P) \\right)_{T}} = \\frac{1}{B}$\n\nwhere the $N_{i}$ and $\\xi$ are kept constant for all partial\nderivatives, and $B$ is the bulk modulus.\n\nIn , $G$ cannot be directly replaced by $G_{m}$ because *N* also depends\non *N<sub>i</sub>*. The thermodynamic quantities under such conditions,\ni.e. varying the amount of a component at constant temperature and\npressure, are called partial quantities which are introduced in Eq. 1\u20118\nfor partial entropy and for partial enthalpy. This definition can be\nextended to all molar quantities such as partial volume and partial\nGibbs energy. Partial quantities of a molar quantity, $A$, can thus be\ndefined in general as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$A_{i} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{j \\neq i},\\ \\xi}$\n\nThe general differential form of a molar quantity for a system at\nequilibrium can be represented by its partial quantities as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dA = \\left( \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T} \\right)dT + \\left( \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial P} \\right)dP + \\sum_{}^{}\\left( \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right){dN}_{i}$\n\nwhere the subscripts representing variables kept constant, i.e. the\nremaining natural variables of Gibbs energy not in the denominator, are\nomitted for simplicity. This will be done throughout the book unless\nspecified otherwise.\n\nUsing the following relations: $A = NA_{m}$, $N = \\sum_{}^{}N_{j}$,\n$x_{i} = N_{i}/N$,\n$\\frac{{\\partial x}_{i}}{{\\partial N}_{i}} = \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)/N$,\nand $\\frac{{\\partial x}_{k}}{{\\partial N}_{i}} = {- x}_{k}/N$, can be\nderived as, under constant T and P,\n\nEq. \u2011\n$A_{i} = A_{m} + N\\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{\\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}}\\frac{\\partial x_{j}}{\\partial N_{i}}} = A_{m} + \\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}}$\n\nwhere the summation is for all *c* components and the partial\nderivatives are taken with other mole fractions kept constant. However,\nmole fractions are not independent, but follow the relation\n$\\sum_{}^{}x_{i} = 1$. Taking $x_{1} = 1 - \\sum_{j = 2}^{c}x_{j}$ as the\ndependent mole fraction, can be rewritten as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$A_{i} = A_{m} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\right) - \\sum_{j = 2}^{c}x_{j}\\left( \\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}} - \\frac{\\partial A_{m}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\right)$\n\nThe difference of the partial derivatives in the parenthesis in\nrepresents the partial derivative of $A_{m}$ with respect to the mole\nfraction of one component when the first component is selected as the\ndependent component. Applying and to Gibbs energy, the partial Gibbs\nenergy or chemical potential of component $i$ is obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} = G_{i} = G_{m} + \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}} = G_{m} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\right) - \\sum_{j = 2}^{c}x_{j}\\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}} - \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\right)$\n\nThe derivatives in the stability equation, , are defined with the molar\nquantities kept constant. On the other hand, Gibbs energy has two\npotentials, temperature and pressure, as natural variables instead. One\nwould thus need to compare the stability conditions when a variable kept\nfixed is changed from a molar quantity to its conjugate potential. This\ncan be carried out through the use of Jacobians to change the\nindependent variables\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{\\partial\\left( Y_{i},Y_{j} \\right)}{\\partial\\left( X_{i},X_{j} \\right)} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{Y_{j}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{i}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{i}} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{i}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}}$\n\nFor a stable system, both\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}}$ and\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{i}}$ are\npositive based on . Using the Maxwell relation shown by , one thus\nobtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{Y_{j}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{i}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}}/\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}} \\geq 0$\n\nThis means that\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{Y_{j}}$ will go\nto zero before\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}}$ does. It\nindicates that the stability condition becomes more restrictive when\npotentials are kept constant in place of their conjugate molar\nquantities. Based on the Gibbs-Duhem equation of , the maximum number of\nindependent potentials is *c+1*, and the last potential is dependent,\ni.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{c + 2}}{\\partial X_{c + 2}} \\right)_{Y_{j \\leq c + 1}} = 0$\n\nTherefore, the limit of stability is determined when the derivative\nbecomes zero with one molar quantity kept constant, e.g.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{c + 1}}{\\partial X_{c + 1}} \\right)_{Y_{j < c + 1},X_{c + 2}} = 0$\n\nThis is because this derivative reaches zero faster than any other\nderivatives with more molar quantities kept constant. shows that all\nmolar quantities diverge at the limit of stability. The consolute point\nis obtained with $c$ additional conditions as follows based on\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}Y_{i}}{\\partial\\left( X_{i} \\right)^{2}} \\right)_{Y_{j \\leq c + 1, \\neq i},X_{c + 2}} = 0$\n\nTogether with , all $c + 1$ independent potentials at the consolute\npoint can be determined. It is evident that the consolute point is a\nzero-dimensional point in a two-dimensional space of independent\npotentials in a one-component system. With the addition of a second\ncomponent to form a binary system, this consolute point in the\none-component system extends into a one-dimensional line. This line\nrepresents the limit of stability of the binary system, and a consolute\npoint is located at the end of this line. It is thus evident that in a\nsystem with $c$ independent components, the limit of stability is a\n*c-1*-dimensional hypersurface in a space of $c + 1$ independent\npotentials, while the consolute point is a zero-dimensional point in all\nsystems, which may be called the invariant critical point.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "71b23714", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Multi-component random solutions\n\nSimilar to a ternary solution, the excess Gibbs energy of mixing of a\nmulti-component solution can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} = \\sum_{i}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}{x_{i}x_{j}L_{ij}}} + \\sum_{i}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}{\\sum_{k}^{}{x_{i}x_{j}x_{k}L_{ijk}}}}$\n\nIn principle, one can add interaction parameters for quaternary and\nhigher order systems, but their contributions to Gibbs energy are\nrelatively minor because the major contributions have already been taken\ninto account by the binary and ternary interactions.

A phase can be represented by a *c+1*-dimensional surface\nin a *c+2*-dimensional space of potentials based on the Gibbs-Duhem\nequation. The directions and curvature of the surface are represented by\nthe partial derivatives shown by and secondary derivatives shown by ,\nboth being negative for a stable phase. To develop a mathematical\nformula for Gibbs energy of a phase with variable compositions, one can\nconsider a phase as a mixture of independent components that the phase\nis made of. Its Gibbs energy function can be postulated as the summation\nof Gibbs energy of the independent components of the same structure of\nthe solution, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}$, plus the contribution due to the mixing,\n$_{\\ }^{mixing}G$ or $_{\\ }^{M}G$\n\nEq. \u2011 $G = \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}} +_{\\ }^{M}G$\n\nSince the system size usually is not important in thermodynamics, its\nproperties are typically normalized to one mole with its composition\nrepresented by mole fractions of components. The molar Gibbs energy is\nobtained as shown below with the molar Gibbs energy of mixing separated\ninto two parts: ideal Gibbs energy of mixing assuming no chemical\ninteraction among components, $_{\\ }^{ideal}G_{m}$ or $_{\\ }^{I}G_{m}$,\nand excess Gibbs energy of mixing due to chemical reaction among\ncomponents, $_{\\ }^{excess}G_{m}$ or $_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = \\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}} +_{\\ }^{M}G_{m} = \\sum_{}^{}{x_{i}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}} +_{\\ }^{I}G_{m} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$\n\nFrom , the chemical potential of a component is thus\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{i} +_{\\ }^{I}{G_{m} +}_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} + \\frac{\\partial\\left(_{\\ }^{I}{G_{m} +}_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} \\right)}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial\\left(_{\\ }^{I}{G_{m} +}_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} \\right)}{\\partial x_{j}}$\n\nOne may define the chemical activity of component *i*, $a_{i}^{\\ }$, as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$RTlna_{i}^{\\ } = \\mu_{i} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{\\ } =_{\\ }^{I}{G_{m} +}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{I}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{I}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} + \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}x_{j}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}}$\n\nIn this definition, the chemical activity or simply activity is\ncalculated with respect to the pure elements in the structure of the\nsolution for practical reasons as one would like to understand the\nchemical potential difference of components in the solution and by\nitself with the same structure. It should be noted that this reference\nstate for chemical activity is usually different from the SER reference\nstate defined in as the solution may have a different structure than\nthose of pure components in their SER states. On the other hand, the\nactivity under the SER reference state can be easily obtained by\nreplacing $_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}$ with ${_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{SER}$ from . In\nprinciple, one may choose any structure as the reference state for\nactivity to be useful for practical applications, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $RTlna_{i}^{ref} = \\mu_{i} -_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{ref}$\n\nFor example, the activity of a component in a liquid solution is defined\nwith respect to the pure component in its liquid form from , but can\nalso be referred to its SER state which is solid using . The following\nsections will discuss in more details how components mix when they are\nbrought together including concepts such as random mixing, short-range\nordering, and long-range ordering.\n\nThe limit of stability of a solution with respect to composition\nfluctuation under constant *T*, *P*, and *N<sub>1</sub>* can be derived\nas follows from and\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{j \\neq i},i > 1} > \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{1},{\\mu_{2},N}_{j \\neq i},i,j > 2}\\ldots... > \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{c}}{\\partial N_{c}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{1},\\mu_{2}..\\mu_{c - 1}} = 0$\n\nThe first term can be derived from as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{i}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{j \\neq i},i > 1} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}\\partial x_{j}}\\frac{\\partial x_{j}}{\\partial N_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}\\sum_{k = 1}^{c}{\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}\\partial x_{k}}\\frac{\\partial x_{k}}{\\partial N_{i}}}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left( \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}^{2}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}^{2}}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}\\partial x_{j}}} + \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{\\sum_{k = 1}^{c}{{x_{j}x}_{k}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{2}G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}\\partial x_{k}}}} \\right)$\n\nDenoting\n$G_{ij} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{j}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{k \\neq j}}$and\nusing to change the variables kept constant from molar quantities to\npotentials one-by-one (see \\[1\\]), the limit of stability can be further\nobtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{c}}{\\partial N_{c}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{1},\\mu_{2}..\\mu_{c - 1}} = \\frac{\\det\\left( G_{ij}:2 \\leq i,j \\leq c \\right)}{\\det\\left( G_{ij}:2 \\leq i,j \\leq c - 1 \\right)} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\det$ stands for determinant. indicates that\n$\\det\\left( G_{ij}:2 \\leq i,j \\leq c \\right) = 0$ at the limit of\nstability.

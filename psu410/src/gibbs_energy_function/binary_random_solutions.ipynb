It is self-evident\nthat both and hold for stable binary solutions too, i.e. the directions\nand the curvature of the surface are all negative. To visualize the\nfour-dimensional surface in the three-dimensional space, one needs to\nfix one of the four potentials. As $T$ and $P$ are the natural variables\nof Gibbs energy, they are usually chosen to be kept constant. One can\ntypically investigate behaviors of systems consisting of condensed\nphases by varying the temperature at constant pressure. at constant\npressure thus becomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - SdT - {N_{A}d\\mu}_{A} - {N_{B}d\\mu}_{B}$\n\nSimilar to and , the property of a phase can be represented by a\ntwo-dimensional surface in the three-dimensional space composed of $T$,\n$\\mu_{A}$, and $\\mu_{B}$ under constant $P$, keeping in mind the\nfollowing\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = x_{A}\\mu_{A} + x_{B}\\mu_{B} = x_{A}_{\\ }^{0}G_{A} + x_{B}_{\\ }^{0}G_{B} + RT\\left( x_{A}l{nx}_{A} + x_{B}l{nx}_{B} \\right) +_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$\n\nSince $_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}$ must be zero for pure components $A$ and $B$, it\nneeds to be in the following form\n\nEq. \u2011 $_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} = x_{A}x_{B}L_{AB}$\n\nwith $L_{AB}$ being a parameter denoting the interaction between\ncomponents $A$ and $B$, called interaction parameter. When $L_{AB} = 0$,\nthe solution is an ideal solution. When $L_{AB}$ is a non-zero constant\nindependent of temperature and composition, the solution is called a\nregular solution. Its excess entropy and excess enthalpy of mixing are\nobtained as\n\nEq. \u2011 $_{\\ }^{E}S_{m} = \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{m}}{\\partial T} = 0$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{E}H_{m} =_{\\ }^{E}G_{m} - T_{\\ }^{E}S_{m} = x_{A}x_{B}L_{AB}$\n\nThe chemical potential of component $A$ or $B$ in a binary regular\nsolution can be derived as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{i} + RTlnx_{i} + \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)^{2}L_{AB}$\n\nIn a dilute solution with $x_{i} \\rightarrow 0$, one can have\n\nEq. \u2011\n$RTln\\gamma_{i} = \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)^{2}L_{AB} \\approx L_{AB}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma_{i} = e^{\\frac{L_{AB}}{RT}}$\n\nThe activity is thus proportional to its mole fraction, which is called\nHenry\u2019s law. By the same token, for the solvent, i.e.\n$x_{i} \\rightarrow 1$,\n\nEq. \u2011 $RTln\\gamma_{i} = \\left( 1 - x_{i} \\right)^{2}L_{AB} \\approx 0$\n\nwhich gives $\\gamma_{i} \\approx 1$, and its activity approaches its mole\nfraction. This is called Raoult\u2019s law.\n\nThe stability of a binary solution is derived from as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{B}} = \\left\\lbrack \\frac{RT}{x_{A}} - 2\\left( 1 - x_{A} \\right)L_{AB} \\right\\rbrack\\frac{1 - x_{A}}{N}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{B}}{\\partial N_{B}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{A}} = \\left\\lbrack \\frac{RT}{x_{B}} - 2\\left( 1 - x_{B} \\right)L_{AB} \\right\\rbrack\\frac{1 - x_{B}}{N}$\n\nIt should be noted that the two chemical potentials in a binary system\nat constant temperature and pressure are dependent on each other due to\nthe Gibbs-Duhem equation shown in , i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - {N_{A}d\\mu}_{A} - {N_{B}d\\mu}_{B}$\n\nand the two chemical potentials depend on each other by the following\nrelation\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\mu_{A}}{\\partial\\mu_{B}} \\right)_{T,P} = - \\frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}}$\n\nTherefore, at the limit of stability, both and go to zero at the same\ntime, which is obtained when\n\nEq. \u2011 $RT = 2{x_{A}x_{B}L}_{AB}$\n\nAs the absolute temperature cannot be negative, has no solution for a\nsolution phase with $L_{AB} < 0$, i.e. the solution phase is stable with\nrespect to the composition fluctuation. For a solution with\n$L_{AB} > 0$, its limit of stability is represented .\n\nA schematic molar Gibbs energy of a solution with $L_{AB} < 0$ at\nconstant temperature and pressure is shown in along with the ideal and\nexcess Gibbs energy of mixing. A tangent line on the molar Gibbs energy\nof the solution is drawn, and its two intercepts at $x_{B} = 0$ and\n$x_{B} = 1$ give the chemical potentials of components $A$ and $B$,\n$\\mu_{A}$ and $\\mu_{B}$ by , respectively. It is evident that $\\mu_{A}$\nand $\\mu_{B}$ are not independent on each other as they are two points\non the same straight line. This is a graphic representation of the\nGibbs-Duhem equation of . The chemical activity of component $B$ is also\ndepicted with the reference state being the pure B with the same\nstructure. As shown in , other structures of pure B can be selected as\nthe reference states of the chemical activity of component B, resulting\nin the different distances to its chemical potential in the solution,\nthus different values of its chemical activities. It is clear that this\nchange of reference state for chemical activity does not affect the\nchemical potential of the component in the solution.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic molar Gibbs energy diagram with $L_{AB} < 0$\n\nWhen $L_{AB} > 0$, represents a parabola in the $T - x_{i}$\ntwo-dimensional coordinate, symmetric with respect to $x_{A}$ and\n$x_{B}$, shown in , i.e. the spinodal of the solution. The consolute\npoint is obtained by applying to and letting equal to zero at the\nconsolute point\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mu_{A}}{\\partial N_{A}^{2}} \\right)_{T,P,N_{B}} = \\left\\lbrack - \\frac{RT}{x_{A}^{2}} + 2L_{AB} \\right\\rbrack\\left( \\frac{1 - x_{A}}{N} \\right)^{2} = 0$\n\nwhich gives\n\nEq. \u2011 $T_{cons} = 2x_{A}^{2}L_{AB}$\n\nSolving and , one obtains $x_{A} = x_{B} = 0.5$ and\n\nEq. \u2011 $T_{cons} = \\frac{L_{AB}}{2R}$\n\nFigure \u2011: A Spinodal curve with $L_{AB} > 0$\n\nA schematic molar Gibbs energy diagram at temperatures below the\nconsolute point is shown in . It can be seen that part of the molar\nGibbs energy has negative curvature, and the solution becomes unstable.\nThe chemical potential thus does not change monotonically with respect\nto composition and its derivative changes sign at the inflexion point.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic molar Gibbs energy diagram with $L_{AB} > 0$\n\nFor more complex solutions, $L_{AB}$ can be a function of temperature,\npressure, and compositions. In principle, the temperature and pressure\ndependences can be treated by means of formula similar to . There are\nvarious approaches in the literature to consider the composition\ndependence of $L_{AB}$. The empirical Redlich-Kister polynomial stands\nout as the one most widely used because it can be extrapolated to\nternary and multi-component systems consistently, which will be\ndiscussed in Chapter .\n", "metadata": {}}]}

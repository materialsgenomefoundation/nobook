The number of\nrepeating units is called the degree of polymerization and can be as\nlarge as 10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup>. It defines the molecular mass,\ni.e. the mass of one polymer molecule. There are three typical\narchitectures of polymerization: a linear chain, a branched chain, and a\ncross-linked polymer. Nearly all polymers are mixtures of molecules with\na different degree of polymerization with a molecular mass distribution,\ncomplicating the modeling of their thermodynamic properties because of\nthe dependence of properties on molecular mass.\n\nGibbs energy functions of polymers with a single molecular mass can be\ntreated similarly as in Chapter . For a polymer solution, the ideal\nentropy of mixing is quite different from that of atomically random\nsolutions discussed in Chapter because the monomers in a polymer\nmolecule are connected to each other and cannot move freely. One common\napproach to calculate the ideal entropy of mixing is to evoke a lattice\nmodel and assume that one monomer occupies a lattice site with a fixed\nvolume. The number of translational states of a single molecule is equal\nto the number of lattice sites available. In a homogeneous solution, the\ntotal number of lattice sites available is\n\nEq. \u2011 $n = \\sum_{i}^{}{m_{i}n_{i}}$\n\nwhere $n_{i}$ and $m_{i}$ are the number of molecule $i$ and the number\nof lattice sites per molecule $i$, respectively. While in its pure\nstate, i.e. before mixing, the number of states of molecule $i$ in terms\nof the number of lattice sites is\n\nEq. \u2011 $w_{i} = m_{i}n_{i} = n\\varphi_{i}$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{i}$ is the volume fraction of molecule $i$ in the\nsolution. The entropy change per molecule $i$ is thus\n\nEq. \u2011\n$S_{i} = kln(n) - klnw_{i} = kln\\frac{1}{\\varphi_{i}} = - kln\\varphi_{i}$\n\nThe total entropy of mixing is the summation for all molecules,\nnormalized to per mole of lattice site\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{}^{I}S_{m} = \\frac{N_{a}}{n}\\sum_{i}^{}{n_{i}S_{i}} = - R\\sum_{i}^{}{\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}\\ln\\varphi_{i}}$\n\nwhere $N_{a}$ is the Avogadro number. When $m_{i} = 1$ for all\nmolecules, Eq. 2\u2011143 reduces to . Since $m_{i}$ values are typically\nvery large numbers for polymers, the entropy of mixing in polymer\nsolutions and blends is thus significantly lower than those in\nnon-polymer solutions as shown schematically in for binary systems with\nvarious $m_{i}$ values.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic entropy of mixing in solutions with the numbers of\nlattice sites per molecule shown.\n\nSimilar to , Gibbs energy of a multi-component random polymer\nsolution/blend can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{m} = \\sum_{}^{}\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}_{\\ }^{0}G_{im} + RT\\left( \\sum_{}^{}{\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{m_{i}}\\ln\\varphi_{i}} + \\sum_{}^{}{\\varphi_{i}\\varphi_{j}\\chi_{ij}} \\right)$\n\nwhere $_{\\ }^{0}G_{im}$ is the Gibbs energy of molecular $i$ per mole of\nlattice site, and $\\chi_{ij}$ the unitless interaction parameter between\nmolecule $i$ and $j$.

As $x_{i}$ is\nsmaller than unity, the entropy production to form an ideal solution\nfrom pure components is thus positive, indicating that it is a\nspontaneous process. In such an ideal solution, it is assumed that there\nare no interactions between components, and the enthalpy of mixing is\nthus zero as the internal energy and the volume of the system do not\nchange.

The partial derivatives in\nrepresent the directions of molar Gibbs energy in the composition space,\ni.e. the tangents of molar Gibbs energy with respect to mole fractions\nof independent components. Collectively, they define the\nmulti-dimensional tangent plane of molar Gibbs energy at the given\ncomposition, $x_{i}^{0}$. The mathematical representation of this\ntangent plane, $z_{G_{m}}$, is defined by its directional derivatives\nand the distance from the point where the derivatives are taken,\n\nEq. \u2011\n$z_{G_{m}} = G_{m}\\left( x_{i}^{0} \\right) + \\sum_{i = 1}^{c}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right)_{x_{i}^{0}}\\left( x_{i} - x_{i}^{0} \\right)}$\n\nThe intercept of this tangent plane at each pure component axis, i.e.\n$x_{i} = 1$ and $x_{j \\neq i} = 0$, is obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$z_{G_{m},x_{i} = 1} = G_{m}\\left( x_{i}^{0} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right)_{x_{i}^{\\ } = x_{i}^{0}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}^{0}\\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{m}}{\\partial x_{j}} \\right)_{x_{i}^{\\ } = x_{i}^{0}}}$\n\nThis is identical to at the point $x_{i}^{0}$. It is thus shown that the\nchemical potential of a component in a solution is represented by the\nintercept of the tangent plane of Gibbs energy of the solution on the\n$G_{m}$ axis of the component. The distance between the intercept and\nthe Gibbs energy of the pure component in the same structure of the\nsolution is related to the chemical activity of the component as defined\nby . On the other hand, it is evident that one can choose any other\nstructure of the pure element to define the chemical activity to compare\nchemical potential of the component as shown by .\n\nThe stability of a solution is evaluated following , and the derivatives\nof chemical potential with respect to its moles, i.e. the elements in\nthe determinant, are obtained as follows from and ,\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{N}{RT}\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{i}} = \\frac{N}{RT}G_{ii} = \\frac{1 - x_{i}}{x_{i}} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{i}}\\left( \\frac{\\partial\\gamma_{i}}{\\partial x_{i}} - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}\\frac{\\partial\\gamma_{i}}{\\partial x_{j}}} \\right)$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{N}{RT}\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{k}} = \\frac{N}{RT}G_{ik} = - \\frac{x_{k}}{x_{i}} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{i}}\\left( 1 - \\sum_{j = 1}^{c}{x_{j}\\frac{\\partial\\gamma_{i}}{\\partial x_{j}}} \\right)$\n\nTo further study Gibbs energy of solution phases, let us discuss the\ndetails on the excess Gibbs energy of mixing. At this point, one can\nstart with lower-order systems with fewer components, i.e. two component\nand three-component systems, noting that the Gibbs energy of phases with\none component is already presented in Chapter .\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "ab833401", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Solutions with both short-range and long-range ordering\n\nThe short-range ordering in a solution with long-rang ordering can take\nplace in each sublattice or between two sublattices. The short-range\nordering in one sublattice can be treated similarly as in Chapter 2.3.1\nwith mole fractions substituted by site fractions. In case that\nassociates form, the relation between mole fractions and site fractions\nbecomes more complicated as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$x_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}\\sum_{k}^{}{i_{k}y}_{k}^{t}}}{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}\\left( 1 - y_{va}^{t} \\right)}}$\n\nwhere the summation for $k$ goes over all associates in sublattice $t$\ncontaining component $i$.\n\nThe short-range ordering between two-sublattices indicates that a\ncomponent in one sublattice has different interactions with different\ncomponents in another sublattice. This results in local ordering of one\ncomponent around another component in two neighboring sublattices. Such\nlocal ordering involves interactions between two sublattices shown as\nthe third term in .\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "09d5f96a", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Solutions with charged species\n\nOne special type of solutions with both short-range and long-range\nordering is solutions with charged species, i.e. ionic solutions, plus\nelectrons and holes. There is an additional constraint on species\nconcentrations to maintain the charge neutrality of such solutions, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = \\sum_{t}^{}{\\sum_{i}^{}{a^{t}y_{i}^{t}v_{i}^{t}}}$\n\nwhere $v_{i}^{t}$ is the valance of species $i$ in sublattice $t$\nincluding its sign which is positive for cations, negative for anions,\nand zero for neutral species. The conventional defect chemistry theory\nis typically based on the ideal mass action laws and applicable to a\nsingle set of defects and at very low defect concentrations, i.e. in the\nlimit of ideal solutions. For interacting defects, their concentrations\nshould be replaced by their activities, which can be obtained from\nthermodynamic principles similarly as discussed in previous sections. It\nshould be emphasized that in addition to formation of many more charged\nspecies, one component may have different valences, particularly the\ntransition metals. Consequently, there can be many more species in an\nionic phase than the number of independent components in the system, and\ntheir concentrations can be found by equilibrium calculations as\ndiscussed in Chapter .\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "fe69a707", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Solutions with long-range ordering\n\nSo far, solutions in which a component can occupy any site in a phase\nare discussed. In many phases, this is not the case. For example, in the\nfcc solid solution of Fe and C, Fe atoms take the fcc lattice sites, and\nC atoms occupy the interstitial sites between the fcc lattice sites.\nTherefore, Fe atoms do not mix with C atoms on the fcc lattice sites,\nand they rather develop long-rang ordering by occupying their own\ndistinct sites in the phase. Long-range ordering can also develop when\nshort-range ordering extends to the whole lattice. New formula for the\nGibbs energy of mixing is needed by considering the details how\ncomponents are distributed and mixed in various sites in a phase.\n\nOne way to group various sites in a phase is based on equivalent\ncrystallographic positions in a phase, i.e. Wyckoff positions. Various\nsets of equivalent positions divide the lattice into sub-sets of\nlattices. Each set of equivalent positions forms a sublattice. The\ndistributions of components on each sublattice can be represented by\nmole fractions of components in the sublattice, commonly referred to as\nsite fractions and defined as\n\nEq. \u2011 $y_{i}^{t} = \\frac{N_{i}^{t}}{\\sum_{j}^{}N_{j}^{t}}$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\sum_{i}^{}y_{i}^{t} = 1$\n\nwhere the superscript $t$ denotes the sublattice in which the component\nresides, and the summation is for all species in sublattice $t$\nincluding vacancy. Site fractions and mole fractions are related through\nthe mass balance as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$x_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}y_{i}^{t}}}{\\sum_{}^{}{a^{t}\\left( 1 - y_{va}^{t} \\right)}}$\n\nwhere $a^{t}$ and $y_{va}^{t}$ are the number of sites and the site\nfraction of vacancy in the sublattice *t*.\n\nRandom solutions form when each component enters all sublattices\nequally. Mole fractions and site fractions thus become identical.\nSolutions with both substitutional and interstitial component, like the\nfcc Fe-C solution mentioned above, can be represented by two\nsublattices. Stoichiometric compounds have its site fractions equal to\nunity in each sublattice. When site fractions in a compound deviate from\nunity, the compound is no longer stoichiometric and develops a\ncomposition range of homogeneity. When the composition range is small,\nthe deviations are often referred to as defects. Since many properties\nof a compound are determined by defects, a distinct field of defect\nchemistry exists, predominantly for charged species. As will be\ndemonstrated in Chapter and the rest of the book, defects can be treated\nas an integral part of the thermodynamics of a phase with more than one\nsublattices.\n\nLet us consider a case where there is only one component in each\nsublattice, which represents one possible stoichiometric composition of\nthe phase and is often called an end-member of the phase. The Gibbs\nenergy of an end-member is the same as that of a phase with a fixed\ncomposition shown by or or . By re-arranging , Gibbs energy of an\nend-member, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{em}$, is obtained as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{0}G_{em} = \\sum_{t}^{}{a^{t}{_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{t,ref}} + \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}G_{em}$\n\nwhere ${_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{t,ref}$ represents the Gibbs energy of\ncomponent $i$ in a given reference state which occupies sublattice $t$\nin the end-member. For vacancy, $_{\\ }^{0}G_{Va} = 0$ is defined. The\ncontribution of each end-member to the Gibbs energy of the phase is the\nproduct of site fraction of each component in their respective\nsublattices and the Gibbs energy of the end-member per mole of formula\nunit (*mf*), i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{0}G_{mf} = \\sum_{em}^{}\\left( \\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{em} \\right)$\n\nThe ideal mixing in each sublattice is similar to that in a random\nsolution with mole fractions substituted by site fractions. The excess\nGibbs energy of mixing consists of two contributions: (i) the mixing in\none sublattice with all other sublattices containing only one component\nin each sublattice and (ii) the mixing simultaneously in more than one\nsublattices. The Gibbs energy of a solution phase with multi-sublattices\ncan thus be written in terms of per mole of formula unit as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$G_{mf} =_{\\ }^{0}G_{mf} + RT\\sum_{t}^{}{a^{t}\\sum_{i}^{}{y_{i}^{t}\\ln y_{i}^{t}}} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$\n\nwith $_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$ given by\n\nEq. \u2011\n$_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf} = \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}L_{i,j:l}^{t}}}} + \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j > k}^{}{\\sum_{k}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}y_{k}^{t}L_{i,j,k:l}^{t}}}}} + \\sum_{t}^{}{\\prod_{s \\neq t,u}^{}y_{l}^{s}\\sum_{i > j}^{}{\\sum_{j > k}^{}{\\sum_{k}^{}{y_{i}^{t}y_{j}^{t}y_{m}^{u}y_{n}^{u}L_{i,j:m,n:l}^{t}}}}}$\n\nThe first term in represents the binary interaction between component\n$i$ and $j$ in sublattice $t$ with sublattice $s$ occupied by component\n$l$ with comma separating interacting components in one sublattice and\ncolon separating sublattices. The product,\n$\\prod_{s \\neq t}^{}y_{l}^{s}$, runs through all other sublattices with\none component in each sublattice, except sublattice $t$ in which the\ninteraction is considered. The second term denotes the ternary\ninteraction among $i$, $j$, and $k$ in sublattice $t$ with sublattice\n$s$ occupied by component $l$. The third term depicts the interactions\nsimultaneously in both sublattice $t$ and $u$, and the product runs\nthrough all other sublattices with one component in each sublattice,\nexcept sublattice $t$ and $u$ in which the interactions are considered.\nThe third term thus partially reflects the short-range ordering among\ncomponents between two sublattices. In principles, high-order\ninteraction parameters such as quaternary, quinary, and multiple\nsublattice interaction parameters could be added, but their\ncontributions to $_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}$ are small due to the physical\ninsignificance of co-location of four or five components indicated by\nthe product of their site fractions in front of the interaction\nparameters.\n\nIn , the chemical potential of a stoichiometric compound was defined in\nterms of a summation of chemical potential of individual components in\nthe compound because the relative amounts of components are constrained\nby the stoichiometry of the compound and chemical potentials of\nindividual components can not vary independently. By the same token, the\nchemical potential of an end-member in a solution can be written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\mu_{em} = G_{em} = \\sum_{t}^{}a^{t}\\mu_{i}^{t}$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{i}^{t}$ is the chemical potential of component $i$ that\noccupies the sublattice $t$ in the end-member, and can be derived using\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i}^{t} = a^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{t,ref} + a^{t}RTlny_{i}^{t} +_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ } + \\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ }}{\\partial y_{i}^{t}} - \\sum_{j}^{\\ }y_{j}^{t}\\frac{\\partial_{\\ }^{E}G_{mf}^{\\ }}{\\partial y_{j}^{t}}$\n\nFor constant interaction parameters in , for chemical potential reduces\nto the following expression from\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\mu_{i}^{t} = a^{t}_{\\ }^{0}G_{i}^{t} + a^{t}RTlny_{i}^{t} + \\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{\\left( y_{i}^{t} \\right)^{2}L}_{i,j}^{t} + \\sum_{k > j}^{}{\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{y_{j}^{t}y_{k}^{t}\\left\\lbrack L_{i,j}^{t} + L_{i,k}^{t} - L_{j,k}^{t} + \\left( 1 - 2y_{i}^{t} \\right)L_{i,j,k}^{t} \\right\\rbrack}}$\n\nThe stability of the solution is defined by\n$\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{em}}{\\partial N_{em}}$ with $N_{em}$ being the moles\nof the end-member in the solution given by\n$N_{em} = N\\prod_{u}^{}y_{j}^{u}$ and\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{\\partial N_{em}}{\\partial y_{j}^{u}} = \\frac{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t}}{y_{j}^{u}\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{i}^{t} \\right)}$\n\nFollowing , one obtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{em}}{\\partial N_{em}} = \\sum_{u}^{}{\\frac{\\partial\\left( \\sum_{t}^{}a^{t}\\mu_{i}^{t} \\right)}{\\partial y_{j}^{u}}\\frac{\\partial y_{j}^{u}}{\\partial N_{em}}} = \\frac{\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t} \\right)}{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t}}\\sum_{u}^{}{a^{u}y_{i}^{u}\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}^{u}}{\\partial y_{i}^{u}}} = \\frac{\\left( 1 - \\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t} \\right)}{N\\prod_{t}^{}y_{j}^{t}}\\sum_{u}^{}{a^{u}y_{i}^{u}\\left\\{ \\frac{RT\\left( 1 - y_{i}^{u} \\right)}{y_{i}^{u}} - 2\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}\\left( y_{j}^{u} \\right)^{2}L_{i,j}^{u} - 2\\sum_{k > j}^{}{\\sum_{j \\neq i}^{}{y_{j}^{u}y_{k}^{u}\\left\\lbrack L_{i,j}^{u} + L_{i,k}^{u} - L_{j,k}^{u} + \\left( 2 - 3y_{i}^{u} \\right)L_{i,j,k}^{u} \\right\\rbrack}} \\right\\}}$\n\nIt is self-evident from that a site fraction is only uniquely defined\nfrom the mole fraction of the component when the component enters into\none sublattice only and does not form any associates. Therefore, in\ngeneral, the distribution of components on sublattices and different\nkinds of molecules can only be obtained by equilibrium calculations, and\nthe thermodynamic properties for such a phase can thus not be\nrepresented in a closed form using mole fractions of independent\ncomponents. This was demonstrated in Chapter when short-range ordering\nexists in solution phases, where the energy minimization procedure was\nused to obtain the distribution of components on different kinds of\nbonds and the amounts of individual associates.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "82f8e314", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Solutions with short-range ordering\n\nThe order in a system can be measured by correlation functions which\ndescribes how various components are correlated in space.

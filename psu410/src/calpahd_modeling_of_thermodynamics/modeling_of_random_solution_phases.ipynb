When\nthe short-range ordering is weak, it can be accounted for by the\ncomposition-dependence of excess Gibbs energy in a binary system in\nterms of the Redlich-Kister polynomial as follows\n\n*Eq. 6\u20117*\n\nwhere the interaction parameters, , can be temperature dependent or even\nhave contributions from heat capacity in the form of when data is\navailable. shows that and are symmetrical with respect of composition,\nwhile is asymmetrical. Their individual contributions to the excess\nGibbs energy are shown in with all interaction parameters being -30,000\nJ/mole-of-atoms.\n\nFigure \u2011: Contributions of interactions parameters to the excess Gibbs\nenergy\n\nIt can be seen in that even though all interaction parameters are\nnegative, the asymmetrical feature of results in the curvature change in\nthe excess Gibbs energy as a function of composition. This indicates the\ntendency to form a miscibility gap at low temperatures. The interaction\nparameters are to be evaluated from the data of enthalpy, entropy, and\nheat capacity of mixing. The experimental data on enthalpy of mixing are\navailable for the liquid phase in some systems, but typically very\nlimited for solid solution phases. The first-principles calculations can\npredict the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity of mixing in solid\nsolution phases using the dilute solution approach with one solute atom\nin a supercell and the CPA/CE/SQS approach for concentrated solutions as\ndiscussed in Chapter . It demonstrates again that the interaction\nparameters and the lattice stability jointly determine the Gibbs energy\nof an individual phase. The change of lattice stability requires the\nre-evaluation of interaction parameters.\n\nFor individual phases with strong short-range ordering, quasichemical or\nassociated models can be used. As discussed in Chapter , with fixed\ncomposition in the system, the amounts of various chemical bonds or\nassociates are related through the mass conservation in the system and\nare calculated through the minimization of Gibbs energy of the phase\nwith given temperature, pressure, and the amount of each independent\ncomponents. The model parameters include the formation energy of bonds\nor associates and interaction between various bonds or associates,\nnoting that pure elements can be considered as the simplest associates.\nThe interactions between pure elements can be predicted from\nfirst-principles calculations as mentioned above, but currently there\nare no efficient approaches to predict the interactions between\nassociates from first-principles calculations.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

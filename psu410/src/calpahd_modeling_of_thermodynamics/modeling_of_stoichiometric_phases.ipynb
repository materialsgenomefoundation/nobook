When\nthese data are not available from experiments, they can be predicted by\nfirst-principles calculations as discussed Chapter . It should be\npointed out that constraints placed on heat capacity of stoichiometric\ncompounds above melting temperatures, i.e. and , have not been\nrigorously implemented in the literature for such modeling, partially\nbecause the heat capacity of the corresponding liquid solution is not\nwell established, and the heat capacity of a compound is often not\navailable.\n\nWhen the data of heat capacity is not available, a simple approach,\ncommonly referred to as Neumann\u2013Kopp Rule assuming that the heat\ncapacity of formation of is zero, can be used. The Gibbs energy of the\ncompound is written as\n\n*Eq. 6\u20116*\n$G = \\sum_{}^{}N_{i}{_{\\ }^{0}G}_{i}^{ref} + \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}S$\n\nwith $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}H$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{f}S$ modeled as\nconstants. An additional draw back of is that the melting temperature of\nthe compound can be higher than those of pure elements, and the heat\ncapacity of the compound may thus be questionable at temperatures higher\nthan the melting temperatures of pure elements due to the non-physical\ncontributions from pure elements based on .\n", "metadata": {}}]}

For the high\ntemperature phase, the enthalpy of transformation from the low\ntemperature phase to the high temperature phase,\n${\\mathrm{\\Delta}H}_{trans}^{}$, can be measured by calorimetry methods\ndiscussed in Chapter , and the entropy of transformation,\n${\\mathrm{\\Delta}S}_{trans}^{}$, is then calculated using the\nequilibrium condition of equal Gibbs energy of the two phases, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 6\u20111*\n${\\mathrm{\\Delta}S}_{trans}^{} = \\frac{{\\mathrm{\\Delta}H}_{trans}^{}}{T_{trans}^{}}$\n\nwhere $T_{trans}^{}$ is the transition temperature.\n${\\mathrm{\\Delta}H}_{trans}^{}$ and ${\\mathrm{\\Delta}S}_{trans}^{}$ are\nthen used to evaluate the integration constants, $b^{'}$ and $a$, in the\nplace of $S_{298.15}$ and $H_{298.15}^{SER}$ for the structure in the\nSER state.\n\nThis works well for the stable temperature range of each phase. However,\nthere is an issue in extrapolation above and below the melting\ntemperature (T<sub>m</sub>). It is known that the heat capacity of the\nsolid phase, , increases with temperature, while that of the liquid\nphase, , is typically constant. The extrapolation of the Gibbs energy of\na solid phase to above its melting temperature can result in the solid\nphase becoming more stable than the liquid phase at high temperatures.\nBy the same token, the extrapolation of the Gibbs energy of a liquid\nphase to below its melting temperature can result in the liquid phase\nbecoming more stable than the solid phase at low temperatures. To\naddress this problem, it is proposed by SGTE that the heat capacity of\nthe solid phase approaches that of the liquid at high temperatures, and\nthat of the liquid phase approaches that of the solid phase at low\ntemperatures using the following equations\n\n1.  for solid at T\\>T<sub>m</sub>\n\n*Eq. 6\u20112*\n\n*Eq. 6\u20113*\n\n2.  for liquid at T\\<T<sub>m</sub>\n\n*Eq. 6\u20114*\n\n*Eq. 6\u20115*\n\nAs an example, the heat capacity of solid fcc Al and liquid Al in the\nSGTE pure element database is plotted in . It can be seen that the heat\ncapacity of fcc Al approaches that of liquid Al at high temperatures,\nwhile the heat capacity of liquid Al approaches that of fcc Al at low\ntemperatures. It ensures that the liquid Al is stable at high\ntemperatures, and fcc Al is stable at low temperatures. However, this\nsimple model for liquid is often not satisfactory, in comparison with\navailable experimental data in supercooled liquid, particularly those\nsystems with glass transitions. New models are thus needed and are being\ndeveloped in the CALPHAD community.\n\nFigure \u2011: Heat capacity of fcc Al solid and liquid as a function of\ntemperature\n", "metadata": {}}]}

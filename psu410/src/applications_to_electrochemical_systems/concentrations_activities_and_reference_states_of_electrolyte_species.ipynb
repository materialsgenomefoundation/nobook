In most studies of electrochemical\ncorrosion and electrodeposition, and in applied work of electrochemical\nengineers, ionic species concentrations are given in units of molarity,\nthe number of moles of a species in a liter of solution (mol/l)\nsymbolically represented in equations by either *c<sub>i</sub>* or\n\\[M<sup>+Z</sup>\\]. The other common concentration used for ionic\nspecies is molality, which is defined as the number of moles of a\nspecies in 1000g of solvent. For dilute aqueous solutions, molarity and\nmolality values are very similar.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter , a practical definition of the activity of a\nspecies *i* is the thermodynamic reactivity, or tendency to react, of\nspecies *i* in the system of interest as compared to *i* in its\nreference state form. The reference state of a species is typically\nchosen as a specific chemical/physical state of the species at 1 atm\nexternal pressure and the temperature of interest. Similarly, a typical\nreference state for ionic species in aqueous solutions is the 1 molar\nideal solution at 1 bar external pressure and the temperature of\ninterest. If an electrolyte solution behaves ideally, then the activity\nof species *i* in solution is\n\n*Eq. 8\u20116*\n$a_{i} = \\frac{c_{i}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)}{c_{i}^{0}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)} = \\frac{c_{i}\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)}{1\\left( \\frac{mol}{l} \\right)} = c_{i}(dimensionless)$\n\nwhere $c_{i}$ is the molar concentration of *i* in the solution divided\nby $c_{i}^{0}$, the 1 molar reference state ideal solution\nconcentration. Thus, in ideal solutions, the activity of an electrolyte\nspecies is numerically equal to its molar concentration. The above\ntreatment of ionic species is equivalent to the common practice of\ndepicting the activity of a gas by the value of its ideal gas partial\npressure in units of bar.\n\nThe activity coefficient corrects for the nonideality of the species in\nsolution as defined in . If the solution is ideal, $\\gamma_{i} = 1$ for\nall concentrations of a species in solution. For all solutions, one\nexpects $\\gamma_{i} \\rightarrow 1$ as $c_{i} \\rightarrow 1$. It is not\npossible to measure $\\gamma_{i^{+}}$ or $\\gamma_{i^{-}}$ for individual\ncharged ions, only a geometric mean of the positive and negative ion\nvalues.

The actual voltage of a\nbattery is lower than the theoretical one due to kinetic limitations of\ncell reactions and resistance to ion diffusion through the electrolyte.\nBased on whether the cell reactions are reversible or not, batteries\ntypically categorized as either primary disposable or secondary\nrechargeable batteries. The net cell reactions in primary disposable\nbatteries are not easily reversible, and electrode materials may not\nreturn to their original forms by applying a higher external potential\nof opposite sign. Consequently, primary batteries cannot be reliably\nrecharged. On the other hand, the net cell reactions in secondary\nbatteries are easily reversible. Furthermore, two half-cells in\nbatteries may use different electrolytes with each half-cell enclosed in\na container and a separator permeable to conducting ions but not the\nbulk of the electrolytes.\n\nOne common primary battery is zinc-carbon battery with a zinc anode\ncylinder and a carbon cathode central rod.

The oldest form of rechargeable battery is the lead-acid\nbatteries used in automotive, and the latest development is the\nlithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. A lead-acid battery typically uses Pb\nand PbO2 as the cathode and anode electrodes and a 35% sulfuric acid and\n65% water solution as the electrolyte. Its anode and cathode reactions\ncan be simplified as follows\n\nEq. 8\u201182 $Pb + SO_{4}^{2 -} = PbSO_{4} + 2e^{-}$\n\nEq. 8\u201183 $PbO_{2} + 4H^{+} + SO_{4}^{2 -} + 2e^{-} = PbSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O$\n\nThe net cell reaction is\n\nEq. 8\u201184 $Pb + PbO_{2} + 2H_{2}SO_{4}^{\\ } = 2PbSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O$.\n\nIts electric potential is represented by the following equation\n\n*Eq. 8\u201185*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{2f}\\left( 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}O} + 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{{PbSO}_{4}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{Pb} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{{PbO}_{2}} - 2_{\\ }^{0}G^{H_{2}SO_{4}} \\right)$\n\nwith the value at 298.15K being 2.651 V calculated from Thermo-Calc\n\\[60\\]. During discharging, the reaction goes to right, and $PbSO_{4}$\nis formed on both anode and cathode, while during charging, the reaction\ngoes to the left, and $Pb$ and $PbO_{2}$ are restored.

LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub> are two of the\nseveral cathode materials used in lithium ion batteries, and the anode\nis typically made of carbon or metallic Li. The anode and cathode\nreactions for LiCoO2 batteries can be written in simple forms as follows\n\nEq. 8\u201186 ${Li}_{x}C_{6} = x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + 6C$\n\nEq. 8\u201187 $x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + {Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2} = LiCoO_{2}$\n\nwith the net reaction and electric potential being\n\nEq. 8\u201188 ${Li}_{x}C_{6} + {Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2} = LiCoO_{2} + 6C$\n\n*Eq. 8\u201189*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{xf}\\left\\{ 6_{\\ }^{0}G^{C} +_{\\ }^{0}G^{{LiCoO}_{2}} - G^{{{Li}_{x}C}_{6}} - G^{{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO}_{2}} \\right\\} = - \\frac{1}{f}\\left\\{ \\left( \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}} - \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{x}C} \\right) - \\frac{1}{x}\\left( \\mu_{LiCoO_{2}}^{{Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{{LiCoO}_{2}} \\right) \\right\\}$\n\nThe electric potential is a function of $x$. The value in the first\nparenthesis in the above equation denotes the chemical potential\ndifference of Li between two electrodes, and the value in the second\nparenthesis represents the chemical potential difference of\n${LiCoO}_{2}$ between the states in the solution phase of\n${Li}_{1 - x}CoO_{2}$ and by itself. Gibbs energies of ${{Li}_{x}C}_{6}$\nand ${{Li}_{1 - x}CoO}_{2}$ need to be obtained as a function $x$ in\norder to calculate the electric potential of the battery.\n\nLiFePO<sub>4</sub> uses metallic lithium as the anode with following\nhalf-cell and net cell reactions\n\nEq. 8\u201190 $xLi = x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-}$\n\nEq. 8\u201191 $x{Li}^{+} + xe^{-} + {Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4} = LiFePO_{4}$\n\nEq. 8\u201192 $xLi + {Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4} = LiFePO_{4}$.\n\nIts electric potential is also a function of $x$, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 8\u201193*\n$\\varepsilon = - \\frac{1}{xf}\\left\\{_{\\ }^{0}G^{LiFePO_{4}} - x\\ ^{0}G^{Li} - G^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} \\right\\} = - \\frac{1}{f}\\left\\{ \\left( \\mu_{Li}^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} - \\ ^{0}\\mu_{Li} \\right) - \\frac{1}{x}\\left( \\mu_{LiFePO_{4}}^{{Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}} -_{\\ }^{0}G^{LiFePO_{4}} \\right) \\right\\}$\n\nThe value in the first parenthesis in the above equation denotes the\nchemical potential difference of Li between two electrodes, and the\nvalue in the second parenthesis represents the chemical potential\ndifference of $LiFePO_{4}$ between the states in the solution phase of\n${Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}$ and by itself. Consequently, Gibbs energy of\n${Li}_{1 - x}FePO_{4}$ needs to be obtained as a function $x$ in order\nto calculate the electric potential of the battery. It is known that\nthere are several miscibility gaps in the $FePO_{4}$ and $LiFePO_{4}$\npsuedo-binary system, in which the chemical potentials are constants, so\nis the electric potential, resulting in stable battery output.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "b49dd005", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Electrochemical cells\n\nA potential difference, i.e. voltage difference, can be generated\nbetween the electrodes in a cell from differences in the potentials of\nthe half-cell reactions.

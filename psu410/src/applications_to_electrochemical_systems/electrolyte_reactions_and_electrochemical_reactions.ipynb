These gradients result in extraneous\npotentials to occur at the electrodes. In such cases cell equilibrium is\nnot established and measured cell potentials are not those for true\npartial equilibrium.

If an external\npotential, \u03b5<sub>ext</sub>, is applied to the cell, chemical reactions\noccur until the cell potential balances to \u03b5<sub>ext</sub>, and no\ncurrent flows. This potential is called open-circuit voltage (OCV) in\nthe literature. It is important to realize that OCV includes all\nreactions that occur on the electrode surface when the electrode is in\ncontact with the electrolyte, such as passivation discussed in Chapter .\nPartial equilibrium in a cell is achieved when the cell potential is\nbalanced by an applied external potential. In such partial equilibrium\ncases, equilibrium thermodynamic analyses can be used even though the\ncell potential is not zero, i.e. \u03b5<sub>cell</sub> \u2260 0. This\ndifferentiates electrochemical systems from other equilibrium systems\ndiscussed previously.\n\nThe number of electrons involved in a net cell reaction is important in\nrelating cell potential and the Gibbs energy change for the cell\nreaction. As will be illustrated later in this section, this number\ndenotes the number of electrons involved in the half-cell reactions that\nwere added to yield the net cell reaction.

This film effectively\nisolates the metal from the corrosive environment, a phenomenon called\npassivation. One interesting experiment by Faraday in 1836 who reported\nthat iron corrodes freely in dilute nitric acid, while in concentrated\nnitric acid, no reaction apparently occurred. To understand this\nphenomenon, let us exam a simple, schematic Pourbaix diagram for the\niron-water system shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic Pourbaix diagram for iron illustrating the\nresolution of the Faraday paradox in the corrosion of iron in nitric\nacid \\[61\\]. Lines (a) (b), and (c) correspond to the equilibria: (a)\n$H^{+} + e^{-} = 1/2H_{2}$; (b) $O_{2} + 4H^{+} + 4e^{-} = 2H_{2}O$; (c)\n$NO_{3}^{-} + 3H^{+} + 2e^{-} = HNO_{2} + H_{2}O$, respectively\n\nFor iron in deaerated acid solution, the partial anodic and cathodic\nreactions are Line 1 $\\left( Fe/{Fe}^{2 +} \\right)$ and Line (a),\nrespectively, resulting in a corrosion potential that lies between Lines\n$1$ and $a$. In oxygenated (aerated) solutions, the corrosion potential\nmay lie between Lines $1$ and $b$, because the reduction of oxygen is a\npossible (likely) cathodic reaction. Since dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> is\nonly a weak oxidizing agent, the principal cathodic reaction was most\nlikely hydrogen evolution, and hence the corrosion potential is expected\nto lie between Lines $1$ and $a$ at relatively high pH, as shown. Since\nthe $Fe/{Fe}^{2 +}$ reaction is relatively fast compared with\n$H^{+}/H_{2}$ on iron, if the corrosion potential is situated below the\nextension of Line 2 (Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) into the\n${Fe}^{2 +}$ stability region, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cannot form\non the surface, even as a metastable phase.\n\nOn the other hand, concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> is a strong oxidizing\nagent due to the reaction:\n$NO_{3}^{-} + 3H^{+} + 2e^{-} = HNO_{2} + H_{2}O$, so that the corrosion\npotential can lie anywhere between Lines $1$ and $c$ at low pH. Since\nReaction (2) is likely to be fast, the corrosion potential will be high\nand certainly will be more positive than the extension of Line 2 into\nthe stability region for ${Fe}^{2 +}$ at low pH. Therefore,\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> becomes metastable and can form between the\naqueous solution and iron. The thickness of this\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> film depends on its dissolution rate into\nthe aqueous solution and its growth rate at the interface with iron,\nwhich depends on the diffusion of ionic species across the film. Its\nexistence results in passivity and the observed kinetic inactivity of\niron in this medium. When the potential becomes even more positive above\nthe extension of Line $3$, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may form on\nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as an additional metastable phase, resulting\nin the commonly observed bilayer structure.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

With every potential substituted by its conjugate molar\nquantity, the dimensionalities of phase regions increase by one until\nthe phase region reaches the dimensionality of the phase diagram. The\naxes of this phase diagram now consist of both potentials and molar\nquantities. The dimensionality of a phase region can thus be represented\nby the following equation based on\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 - p + n_{m} \\leq \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$\n\nwhere $n_{m}$ is the number of molar axes. This equation is applicable\nto phase regions with more than $n_{m} + 1$ phases. For phase regions\nwith $n_{m} + 1$ phases or fewer, the dimensionalities are the same as\nthe phase diagram, i.e. $\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$,\nand no longer vary with the number of molar quantity axes. When all\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ potentials are substituted by their\nconjugate molar quantities, one obtains a complete molar phase diagrams\nto be discussed in Chapter , and all phase regions have the\nsame-dimensionality of $\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$.\n\nFor the sake of graphic visualization, let us exam a two-dimensional\nphase diagram of a one-component system. Topologically, it is equivalent\nto a multi-component system with $n_{s} = c - 1$. In , three\ntwo-dimensional phase diagrams are shown for pure Fe. In principle, one\ncan use any one of them to illustrate mixed potential and molar phase\ndiagrams. For the purpose of practical usefulness, one selects the\n$T - ( - P)$ potential diagram as temperature and pressure are the two\ntypical variables controlled in experiments of one-component systems.\nThe conjugate molar quantities of $- P$ and $T$ are molar volume and\nmolar entropy, respectively. For stable phases, any pair of conjugate\nvariables changes in the same direction as illustrated by and , i.e. the\nphase stable at higher $T$ has higher molar entropy, and the phase\nstable at higher $\u2013P$, i.e. lower pressure, has higher molar volume. Let\nus first substitute $\u2013P$ by $V_{m}$ as shown in a. The dimensionality of\na sing-phase region remains unchanged because of\n$p = 1 < 2 = n_{m} + 1$. The dimensionality of two-phase regions is\nchanged from 1 to 2 due to $\\upsilon_{m} = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2$ from .\n\nFigure \u2011: T-Vm and Sm-(-P) phase diagrams of Fe\n\nAs both phases in a two-phase equilibrium have the same temperature, all\ntie-lines, depicted by dotted lines, are perpendicular to the\ntemperature axis in a. When the molar volume of the system changes from\none end of a tie-line to another end at a constant temperature, the mole\nfraction of one phase increases from 0 to 1, and the mole fraction of\nanother phase decreases from 1 to 0. The tine-lines at various\ntemperatures combine together to form a two-dimensional two-phase\nregion. The two curves at the two ends of tie-lines represent the\nboundaries between the single-phase and two-phase regions and are no\nlonger phase regions themselves. They are thus called phase boundaries.\n\nBy the same token, by changing the temperature at a constant molar\nvolume of the system, the system will locate on different tie-lines with\nthe amounts of the two phases determined by the lever rule. It is thus\nclear that the system maintains the two-phase equilibrium state with\nboth $T$ and $V_{m}$ changing independently inside the two-dimensional\ntwo-phase region. This seems in contradiction to Gibbs phase rule being\n$\\upsilon = 3 - p = 1$ from , but it is not because Gibbs phase rule\napplies strictly to potential phase diagrams only, while the $T - V_{m}$\nphase diagram has one of its axis being a molar quantity. As an\nalternative, one may consider as a modified Gibbs phase rule in\ndescribing the dimensionality of a phase region in a mixed potential and\nmolar phase diagram with $p \\geq n_{m} + 1$.\n\nThe two three-phase equilibria in pure Fe are also represented by\ntie-lines connecting all three phases. The dimensionality of three-phase\nregions is $\\upsilon_{m} = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1$ from , and the three two-phase\ntie-lines for a three-phase equilibrium thus overlap each other with\ntheir three molar volumes on the same tie-line.\n\nLet us examine the two three-phase equilibria in more detail. In the\n\u03b3/\u03b1/\u03b5 three-phase equilibrium at $T_{E} = 756.6\\ K$ and\n$\\left( - P_{E} \\right) = - 1.046 \\bullet 10^{10}\\ Pa$, the molar\nvolumes of \u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03b5 are 6.837, 6.677, 6.582 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$,\nrespectively. There are two two-phase regions at higher temperatures and\none two-phase region at lower temperatures. This is also shown in the\npotential phase diagram of a with two two-phase curves entering into and\none two-phase curve leaving from the three-phase equilibrium point with\ndecreasing temperature. Considering the system with the fixed molar\nvolume equal to that of the $\\gamma$ phase, i.e.\n$V_{m}^{\\ }\\left( T_{E} \\right) = 6.677 \\bullet 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$. At\n$T > T_{E}$, the system is in the single \u03b3 phase region. With decrease\nin temperature across $T_{E}$, it enters into the $\\alpha + \\varepsilon$\ntwo-phase region. This transformation can be written as follows and is\ncalled a eutectoid reaction\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\varepsilon$\n\nThis type of transformations is named as eutectic reaction if the high\ntemperature phase is a liquid phase. If the system molar volume is\nbetween $V_{m}^{\\gamma}$ and $V_{m}^{\\alpha}$ at $756.6K$, with decrease\nof temperature, the system first moves from the single \u03b3 phase region to\nthe $\\alpha + \\gamma$ two-phase region when the\n$\\gamma/(\\alpha + \\gamma)$ phase boundary is crossed. When the\ntemperature reaches $T_{E}$, the eutectoid transformation takes place in\nthe remaining \u03b3 phase. The $\\alpha$ formed prior to the eutectoid\ntransformation is called proeutectoid $\\alpha$. By the same token, when\nthe system molar volume is between $V_{m}^{\\gamma}$ and\n$V_{m}^{\\varepsilon}$ at $756.6K$, proeutectoid $\\varepsilon$ would form\nfollowed by the eutectoid transformation with decrease in temperature.\n\nOn the other hand, the $L/\\delta/\\gamma$ three-phase equilibrium at\n$T_{P} = 1977.9\\ K$ and\n$\\left( - P_{P} \\right) = - 5.111 \\bullet \\ 10^{9}\\ Pa$ has different\ncharacteristics, where the subscript P will be defined shortly. There\nare one two-phase equilibrium above and two two-phase equilibria below\nthe invariant temperature, shown in the potential phase diagram of a\nwith one two-phase curve entering into and two two-phase curves leaving\nfrom the three-phase equilibrium point with decreasing temperature. The\nmolar volumes of $L$, $\\delta$, and $\\gamma$ at $T_{P}$ are 7.735,\n7.542, and 7.498 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$, respectively. For $T > T_{P}$,\nthe two-phase region is $L + \\gamma$. If the system molar volume is\nbetween 7.735 and 7.498 $10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$, i.e.\n$V_{m}^{L}\\left( T_{P} \\right)$ and\n$V_{m}^{\\gamma}\\left( T_{P} \\right)$, when the temperature reaches\n$T_{P}$, $L$ and $\\gamma$ are combined to form $\\delta$ with the\ntransformation written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\gamma \\rightarrow \\delta$\n\nThis type of reactions is called as peritectic reaction or peritectoid\nreaction when the liquid phase is replaced by a solid phase, denoted by\nthe subscript P. At $T < T_{P}$, one or both high temperature phases may\nno longer be present in equilibrium depending on the value of the system\nmolar volume. For\n$V_{m}^{\\ } = V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542 \\bullet 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol$,\nthe peritectic reaction, , can come to completion with no $L$ and\n$\\gamma$ left upon decreasing temperature. For\n$V_{m}^{\\gamma}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.498 < V_{m}^{\\ } < V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542\\ \\left( 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol \\right)$,\nthe liquid phase is consumed, and the system enters the\n$\\gamma + \\delta$ two-phase region. On the other hand, for\n$V_{m}^{\\delta}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.542 < V_{m}^{\\ } < V_{m}^{\\ L}\\left( T_{P} \\right) = 7.735\\ \\ \\left( 10^{- 6}\\ m^{3}/mol \\right)$,\nthe $\\gamma$ phase is consumed instead, and the system enters into the\n$L + \\delta$ two-phase equilibrium region upon cooling.\n\nLet us now replace $T$ by $S_{m}$ to obtain the $( - P) - S_{m}$ phase\ndiagram shown in b. The morphology of this phase diagram is identical to\nthe $T - V_{m}$ phase diagram just discussed with all tie-lines\nperpendicular to the pressure axis. The transformations at the two\nthree-phase equilibria with $( - P)$ decreasing or $P$ increasing are as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\gamma + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\varepsilon$\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\delta \\rightarrow L + \\gamma$\n\nTo visualize two-dimensional phase diagrams of binary systems, one\nusually keeps the pressure constant. One type of commonly used binary\nphase diagram is the temperature-composition ($T - x$) phase diagram. As\nan example, let us re-plot the $T - \\mu_{C}$ potential diagram shown in\ninto a $T - x_{C}$ mixed potential and molar phase diagram by replacing\nthe chemical potential of $C$ by its mole fraction. The $T - x_{C}$\nphase diagram thus obtained is shown in . In this phase diagram there\nare one peritectic reaction and two eutectic reactions as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\delta \\rightarrow \\gamma$\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow \\gamma + C$\n\nEq. 3\u201161 $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\alpha + C$\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - x_{C}\\ $ phase diagram of the Fe-C binary system\n\nIn in Chapter , it was discussed the formation of miscibility gaps due\nto repulsive interactions between components. One example is shown in\nfor the Al-Zn binary system in terms of both $T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential\nphase diagram and $\\ T - x_{Zn}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase\ndiagram.\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential phase diagram (a) and\n$\\ T - x_{Zn}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase diagram (b) of the\nAl-Zn binary system\n\nIn ,there are one eutectic reaction and one eutectoid reaction as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow fcc + hcp$\n\nEq. \u2011 $fcc\\# 1 \\rightarrow fcc\\# 2 + hcp$\n\nThe eutectoid reaction, , is also termed as monotectoid reaction because\nthe fcc phase appears on both sides of the reaction with different\ncompositions, $fcc\\# 1$ and $fcc\\# 2$, due to the miscibility gap. The\nhighest temperature of the miscibility gap is called the consolute point\nas discussed in Chapter , which can be clearly seen in the\n$T - \\mu_{Zn}$ potential phase diagram shown in . This is a critical\npoint, marking the limit of instability as shown in .\n\nWhen there is only one phase on either side of the reaction, i.e. both\nphases have the same composition, the reaction is called a congruent\nreaction. One example is shown in for the $T - x_{SiO_{2}}\\ $ mixed\npotential and molar phase diagram of the CaO-SiO<sub>2</sub>\npseudo-binary system with two congruent reactions as follows\n\nEq. 3\u201164 $L \\rightarrow CaSiO_{3}$\n\nEq. 3\u201165 $L \\rightarrow {Ca}_{2}SiO_{4}$\n\nThey are not invariant reactions based on the Gibbs phase rule. In , it\nis noted that there are one miscibility gap in the liquid phase close to\nthe $SiO_{2}$ side, four eutectic reactions with one being monotectic\ninvolving two liquid phases due to the miscibility gap, and three\nperitectic reactions.\n\nFigure \u2011: $T - x_{SiO_{2}}\\ $ mixed potential and molar phase diagram of\nthe CaO-SiO<sub>2</sub> pseudo-binary system.\n\nLet us generalize the above discussion to phase diagrams with\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ axes. In such a phase diagram, the\nmaximum number of phases is given by as\n$p_{\\max} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2$. The number of phases on the\neither side of an invariant reaction can vary from one phase to\n$p_{\\max} - 1 = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ phases with the remaining\nphases on the other side of the reaction, typically with the potential\ndecreasing from left to right. The invariant reaction with one phase on\nthe left of the reaction is named as eutectic, or eutectoid reaction\ndepending on if the phase on the left of the reaction is liquid or\nsolid. The rest invariant reactions are named as peritectic or\nperitectoid reactions with or without a liquid phase.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "7fa35f9c", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Phase diagrams with only molar quantities\n\nWhen all $\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$ potentials in a potential phase\ndiagrams are replaced by their conjugate molar quantities, one obtains a\nmolar phase diagram with molar quantities on all axes of the phase\ndiagram. For regions with the number of phases\n$p \\leq n_{m} + 1 = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 = p_{\\max}$ (see ), the\nphase regions have the same-dimensionality as that of the phase diagram,\ni.e. all phase regions have the same-dimensionality of\n$\\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$, and any geometric feature with\nlower-dimensionalities, i.e. from 0 to $\\ \\left( c - n_{s} \\right)$, is\nnot phase regions, but phase boundaries between neighbouring phase\nregions. For the sake of graphic visualization, the molar phase diagram\nof pure Fe is shown in obtained by combining the two mixed phase\ndiagrams in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Molar phase diagram of Fe\n\nIn this molar phase diagram, all one-, two-, and three-phase regions are\ntwo-dimensional, the same as the dimensionality of the phase diagram. A\ntwo-phase region is made up by tie-lines connecting the two phases in\nequilibrium, while a three phase-region is surrounded by three two-phase\ntie-lines, i.e. a tie-triangle. The amount of each phase in the\ntie-triangle can be obtained using the lever rule represented by and .\nAs can be seen, phase boundaries between a one-phase region and a\ntwo-phase region are one-dimensional. When the system crosses such a\nphase boundary, the number of phases changes by one from two to one or\nvice versa. Phase boundaries between two- and three-phase regions are\nrepresented by two-phase tie-lines. When the system crosses such a phase\nboundary, the number of phases also changes by one. The\nlowest-dimensional phase boundaries are the points between one- and\nthree-phase regions that are zero-dimensional and the intercept of four\none-dimensional phase boundaries. When the system crosses such a phase\nboundary, the number of phases changes by two.\n\nFor multi-component systems, the phase relations cannot be directly\nvisualized. By representing the system equations in terms of equilibrium\nconditions and level rules on a phase boundary using phases separately\nfrom the two adjacent phase regions, Palatnik and Landau \\[4\\]\npostulated that the difference between the number of unknowns and\nequations gives the dimensionality of the phase boundary and derived the\nfollowing relationships\n\nEq. \u2011 $D^{+} + D^{-} = r - b = c - n_{s} - b$\n\nwhere $D^{+}$ and $D^{-}$ are the numbers of phases added and removed\nwhen the phase boundary is crossed, and $r$ and $b$ are the\ndimensionalities of the phase diagram and the phase boundary,\nrespectively. They termed the as the contact rule, which is named as the\nMPL boundary rule by Hillert \\[1\\].\n\nBy the same token, is applicable to any phase boundary where the two\nadjacent phase regions have the same-dimensionality of the phase\ndiagram, even in phase diagrams with a mixture of potentials and molar\nquantities as the diagram axes. This can be understood because the\npotentials are homogeneous in all phases in equilibrium on the phase\nboundary. The phase boundary is thus equivalent to those in a complete\nmolar phase diagram with its number of components equal to the number of\nmolar axes in a mixed potential and molar phase diagrams minus one, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $c^{'} = n_{m} - 1 = c - n_{s}$\n\nThe last part of stems from the discussion related to when all\n$c^{'} + 1$ potentials are replaced by their conjugate molar quantities,\nwhich is analogous to a molar phase diagram with $\\ c$ independent\ncomponents and $n_{s}$ potentials fixed.\n\nFor a two-dimensional phase diagram with $r = 2$, the phase boundary can\nbe either zero- or one--dimensional. As shown in , the basic element of\na molar phase diagram is a joint of four one-dimensional phase boundary\nlines. When a phase boundary line is crossed, the number of phases is\neither increased or decreased by one. The joint of four one-dimensional\nphase boundary lines is zero-dimensional. The number of phases differs\nby two between the phase regions across the zero-dimensional joint. Two\nscenarios are possible\n\nTwo phases are added or removed, i.e. $D^{+} = 2$ and $D^{-} = 0$ or\n$D^{+} = 0$ and $D^{-} = 2$, and the number of phases in the two phase\nregions differs by two;\n\nOne phase is added, one phase is removed, i.e. $D^{+} = D^{-} = 1$, and\nthe phase regions have the same number of phases.\n\nBy combining the contact rules for both zero- and one-dimensional phase\nboundaries, it is evident that the above two scenarios co-exist in a\njoint of four-phase regions with two-phase regions following the first\nscenario and other two-phase regions following the second scenario.\nBased on the Schreinemakers\u2019 rule generalized by Hillert \\[5\\], each of\nthe two-phase regions with the same number of phases contains one\nextrapolation of the phase boundaries, while the other two-phase regions\ncontain either zero or two extrapolations of the phase boundaries. This\ncan be observed for all the zero-dimensional phase boundaries in and is\nfurther schematically illustrated in for general cases.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic molar phase diagram, demonstrating the\nSchreinemakers\u2019 rule\n", "metadata": {}}]}

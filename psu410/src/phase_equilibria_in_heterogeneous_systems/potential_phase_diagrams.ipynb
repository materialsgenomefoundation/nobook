In the\nliterature, the high temperature and low temperature bcc phases are\nusually denoted by \u03b4 (high temperature) and \u03b1 (low temperature), the fcc\nand hcp phases by \u03b3 and \u03b5, and the liquid phase by L, respectively. In\nthese figures, the two-dimensional areas are single-phase regions where\ntwo potentials can change independently with the system remaining as\nsingle-phase. The lines denote two-phase equilibrium regions where only\none potential can vary independently if the two-phase equilibrium is to\nbe maintained. The points where three two-phase equilibrium lines meet\nrepresent the invariant three-phase equilibria with three potentials\nfixed.\n\nFigure \u2011 $T - ( - P)$, $\\mu_{A} - T$ and $\\mu_{A} - ( - P)$ phase\ndiagrams of pure Fe\n\nBased on the discussions in Chapter , enthalpy and entropy of a phase\nincrease monotonically with temperature, and phases stable at higher\ntemperatures have higher enthalpy and entropy than phases stable at\nlower temperatures. Consequently, the two-phase equilibrium lines in a\n$T - ( - P)$ potential phase diagram have negative slopes if the phase\nstable at higher temperatures also has larger molar volume than the\nphase stable at lower temperatures (note that if $P$ is plotted instead\nof $- P$, the slope is positive). This is the case for the two-phase\nequilibrium lines of \u03b4/L, \u03b3/L, and \u03b3/\u03b4 at high temperatures, and \u03b5/\u03b3\nshown in a. On the other hand, the two-phase equilibrium lines of \u03b1/\u03b5\nand \u03b1/\u03b3 at low temperatures have positive slopes, indicating that \u03b5 and\n\u03b3 have smaller molar volume than \u03b1 as \u03b5 and \u03b3 are more stable at higher\npressures than \u03b1 at constant temperatures. It is thus evident that the\nphase stable at higher pressure can have either higher or lower entropy\nthan the phase stable at lower pressure, and the phase stable at higher\ntemperature can have either higher or lower volume than the phase stable\nat lower temperature. This is the property anomaly discussed in Chapter\n.\n\nAnother useful example of potential phase diagram is the\npressure-temperature phase diagram of $H_{2}O$ shown in with three\nphases: ice, water, and vapour. It is known that the solid ice has many\npolymorphic structures at high pressures, which are not included in this\ndiagram. As in the pure Fe potential phase diagram discussed above, the\nsingle-phase regions of ice, water, and vapour are represented by the\ntwo-dimensional areas with two-degree of freedom based on the Gibbs\nphase rule, the lines are for the two-phase regions of ice-water,\nice-vapour, and water-vapour, and the three-phase equilibrium has\nzero-degree of freedom represented by a point at $273.16\\ K$ and\n$611.73\\ Pa$.\n\nThere are two features in which are different from those of Fe shown in\na. The first feature is that the slope of the liquid-solid two-phase\nequilibrium line in has the opposite sign of that in a. This is because\nsolid ice has larger molar volume than liquid water, while the molar\nvolume of liquid Fe is larger than those of fcc-Fe and bcc-Fe. The\nsecond feature is that the two-phase equilibrium line of water-vapour\nends at $647\\ K$ and $22.064 \\cdot 10^{6}\\ Pa$. Beyond this point, the\ndifference between vapour and water disappears when the pressure and\ntemperature are changed, i.e. it behaves like one phase. This point is a\ncritical point, as discussed in Chapter . However, it should be pointed\nout that it does not represent an invariant reaction as the degree of\nfreedom based on the Gibbs phase rule is equal to one and not zero. On\nthe other hand, both the temperature and pressure of the critical point\nare invariant due to the two constraints introduced by the limit of\nstability of a single phase, i.e. the second and third derivatives of\ntemperature to entropy or pressure to volume are zero.\n\nFigure \u2011: P-T phase diagram of $H_{2}O$\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "8b8697d3", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Potential phase diagrams of two-component systems\n\nFrom Gibbs-Duhem equation (see ), a single phase in a two-component\nsystem has three independent potentials, out of the four potentials of\n$T$, $- P$, $\\mu_{A}$, and $\\mu_{B}$, and is a three-dimensional\ngeometric feature in a four-dimensional space. Alternatively, it can be\nrepresented by a three-dimensional space constructed by the three\nindependent potentials. A two-phase equilibrium is thus a\ntwo-dimensional surface in this three-dimensional space created by the\nintercept of two three-dimensional spaces, and a three-phase equilibrium\nis a one-dimensional line, and a four-phase equilibrium is a\nzero-dimensional point. This is shown in for the Fe-C binary system\ninvolving four phases: fcc, bcc, Fe<sub>3</sub>C and graphite.

However, there is one type of\nwidely used projection in the literature, i.e. the liquidus surface in\nternary systems under constant pressure with temperature and mole\nfractions of two components as its axes. The projection along the\ntemperature axis reveals the composition regions for primary phases that\nsolidify from liquid upon cooling. These regions are separated by\nunivariant lines of three-phase equilibria. The projections along one of\nthe two mole fractions show the temperature as a function of composition\non the univariant three-phase equilibrium lines and also depict whether\na four-phase equilibrium is peritectic or eutectic.

It indicates\nthat the liquid phase does not exist at temperatures below the\nfour-phase invariant reaction. This invariant reaction is thus a ternary\neutectic reaction with liquid completely transformed to three solid\nphases upon cooling, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $L \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma$\n\nIn the second scenario, two univariant lines merge into and one leaves\nfrom the four-phase equilibrium with decreasing temperature. This means\nthat one solid phase at higher temperature is no longer stable at lower\ntemperature, and it must react with the liquid phase to form the\nremaining two solid phases. The four-phase invariant reaction is thus\nperitectic. The solid phase common to both univariant lines at high\ntemperatures reacts with the liquid phase. Assuming that this phase is\n$\\alpha$, the four-phase invariant reaction becomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta + \\gamma$\n\nIn the third scenario, one univariant line points to and two leave from\nthe four-phase equilibrium with decreasing temperature. A new phase\nforms at low temperatures from the three high temperature phases, e.g.\nliquid, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$, with the four-phase invariant reaction as\n\nEq. \u2011 $L + \\alpha + \\beta \\rightarrow \\gamma$\n\nThe fourth scenario is the inverse of the first scenario, indicating the\nformation of liquid from solid phases upon cooling, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma \\rightarrow L$\n\nThis case has not been observed in reality.\n\nAs an example, the liquidus projections of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system\nare shown in in two formats\\[6\\], i.e. (a) three-dimensional liquidus\nsurface with the isotherms showing the liquidus contours; (b)\nconventional projection to the composition axis with the temperature\ndecrease shown by arrows; (c) projection to the temperature and weight\nfraction of Si.

Sectioning of a potential\nphase diagrams is relatively simple as the resulted phase diagram\nbehaves like a system with one component less. The same is true if\npotentials are sectioned in phase diagrams with both potential and molar\nquantities as the section is along the tie-lines of the fixed\npotentials. As an example, shows the ternary Al-Fe-Si potential and\nmolar phase diagrams sectioned at T=1273K and P=1atm, commonly referred\nto as isothermal section. It is evident that the geometric features of\nboth phase diagrams are identical to those of pure Fe shown in and ,\nrespectively, with one-, two-, and three-phase regions and corresponding\nphase boundaries.\n\nFigure \u2011: Ternary isothermal section of the Al-Fe-Si ternary system at\nT=1273K and P=1atm\n\nOn the other hand, when the phase diagram is sectioned along a molar\nquantity, it would usually not follow a tie-line because phases in\nequilibrium usually have different values for the same molar quantity.\nConsequently, there are no tie-lines inside such phase diagrams in\ngeneral, and any phase regions only show which phases are in equilibrium\nwith each other without any information on the values of molar\nquantities of individual phases.\n\nThis type of sectioning reduces both the dimensionalities of the phase\ndiagram and phase boundary by the same number, but does not alter the\nnumber of phases in the adjacent phase regions. The contact rule, i.e. ,\nthus remains valid and is applicable to phase regions with the\nsame-dimensionality as that of the sectioned phase diagram. Similarly,\nthe Schreinemakers\u2019 rule shown in is valid under the same conditions.\n\nFor example, the two-dimensional phase diagram of the Mg-Al-Zn ternary\nsystem sectioned with one atmospheric pressure and the weight fraction\nof Zn fixed at 0.01 is shown in plotted with temperature and mole\nfraction of Al \\[7\\]. This phase diagram is commonly called isopleth and\nis generated by fixing one potential, the pressure, $P$, changing the\nchemical potentials of Al and Zn to their conjugate molar quantities\nrepresented by weight fractions of Al and Zn, and sectioning at\n$w_{Zn} = 0.01$. From the discussions in Chapter , the phase regions\nwith the number of phases equal to three or fewer, i.e.\n$p \\leq n_{m} + 1 = 3$, have the same-dimensionality as the phase\ndiagram, i.e. two-dimensional in the present case, and the phase\nboundary rule is applicable. The maximum number of phases co-existing at\nequilibrium is given by as following for the present case\n\nEq. \u2011 $p_{\\max} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 = 3 - 1 + 2 = 4$\n\nThis is because introducing molar quantities only increases the\ndimensionality of phase regions and does not change the maximum number\nof co-existing phases.\n\nThe dimensionality of a four-phase region is calculated from as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\upsilon_{m} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 - p + n_{m} - n_{ms} = 3 - 1 + 2 - 4 + 2 - 1 = 1$\n\nwhere $n_{ms}$ is the number of sectioned molar quantities. Since the\ndimensionality of a four-phase region is lower than that of the phase\ndiagram, the phase boundary rule cannot be applied directly. Such a\nfour-phase region, liquid+Mg+\u03b3+\u03c6, is shown in between three three-phase\nregions of liquid+Mg+\u03b3, liquid+Mg+\u03c6, and Mg+\u03b3+\u03c6.\n\nFigure \u2011: Isopleth with the weight fraction of Zn fixed at 0.01 of the\nMg-Al-Zn ternary system.\n\nalso displays information on what phases are in equilibrium for a given\nalloy at various temperatures. One example is shown by the dotted\nvertical line marking the weight fraction of Al being 0.09, a widely\nused Mg alloy called AZ91. Various phases are present at different\ntemperature ranges, but the equilibrium phase fractions and phase\ncompositions are not shown in the figure as the tie-lines are not in the\nplane of the phase diagram and have to be calculated at each temperature\nindividually. shows the amount of each phase of the AZ91 alloy as a\nfunction of temperature with the dotted lines depicting the values under\nthe equilibrium condition and the solid lines depicting the values under\nthe so-called Scheil condition assuming no diffusion in solid phases and\ninfinitelyfast diffusion in liquid. Similarly, the composition of each\nphase can also be plotted as shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Mole fraction of individual phases under equilibrium (dotted\ncurves) and Scheil (solid curves) conditions in the AZ91 alloy\n\nFigure \u2011: Mass fraction of Al and Zn in the Mg solid solution phase\nunder equilibrium (dotted curves) and Scheil (solid curves) conditions\nin AZ91\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "f06dd6a3", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Section of potential phase diagrams\n\nBased on the Gibbs-Duhem equation (see ), a single-phase equilibrium in\na system with more than two independent components has more than three\nindependent potentials. There is no problem in representing them using\nthe mathematical formulas discussed so far, but it is not possible for\nus to visualize graphically the full potential phase diagrams in\nmulti-component systems with more than two independent components. In\nprinciples, there are two options. One option is to project the\nmulti-dimensional potential phase diagram into a two- or three-dimension\ndiagram, and another option is to section the multi-dimensional\npotential phase diagram by fixing the values of some potentials.\n\nThe projection approach is used for one-component systems in Chapter .\nSince a two-phase equilibrium in a one-component potential phase diagram\nis one-dimensional, the projection does not lose any information, and\nthe same is true for a three-phase equilibrium in a one-component\npotential phase diagram. In a binary system, the projections of three-\nand four-phase equilibria do not lose any information, while the\nprojections of two-phase equilibria become two-dimensional and cannot\nretain all the information as the original-dimensionality of these\ntwo-phase equilibria is three. Consequently, sectioning at fixed values\nof some potentials is necessary in order to visualize the phase\nrelations in systems with two or more components. Gibbs phase rule shown\nin and are thus modified to\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\upsilon = c + 2 - p - n_{s} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2 - p$\n\nEq. \u2011 $p_{\\max} = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 2$\n\nwhere $n_{s}$ is the number of potentials fixed in sectioning. As can be\nseen in the last part of , the number of sectioning is equivalent to the\nreduction of the effective number of independent components. Therefore,\nany multi-component systems with $n_{s} = c - i$ behave like an\n$i$-component system. The equations presented in Chapter and are thus\ndirectly applicable to multi-component systems with $n_{s} = c - 1$ and\n$n_{s} = c - 2$, respectively.\n\nA common practice in experiments is to fix pressure, temperature or\nchemical potentials of volatile components as they are usually the\nvariables controlled experimentally. In a binary system, the potential\nphase diagram at constant pressure can be represented by any two of the\nthree potentials, i.e. two chemical potentials and temperature, with the\nremaining potential being dependent, and has the identical morphology as\na one-component system. The Gibbs-Duhem equation under such conditions\nbecomes\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - SdT - {N_{A}d\\mu}_{A} - {N_{B}d\\mu}_{B}$\n\nThe corresponding two-phase Clausius-Clapeyron equations are written as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{dT}{{d\\mu}_{A}} = - \\frac{{\\mathrm{\\Delta}z}_{A}^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\mathrm{\\Delta}S_{mB}^{\\alpha\\beta}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{dT}{{d\\mu}_{B}} = - \\frac{{\\mathrm{\\Delta}z}_{B}^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\mathrm{\\Delta}S_{mA}^{\\alpha\\beta}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{{d\\mu}_{A}}{{d\\mu}_{B}} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\left( \\frac{1}{S_{mB}^{}} \\right)^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\left( \\frac{1}{S_{mA}^{}} \\right)^{\\alpha\\beta}}$\n\nAs an example, the $T$-$\\mu_{C}$ potential phase diagram for the Fe-C\nbinary system at one atmospheric pressure is shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: $T$-$\\mu_{C}$ potential phase diagram for the Fe-C binary\nsystem at $P = 1atm$\n\nIn a ternary system, two potentials need to be fixed in order to obtain\ntwo-dimensional potential phase diagrams. When the pressure and the\nchemical potential of one species are fixed, the system behaves like a\nbinary system discussed above. When the system temperature and pressure\nare fixed, the Gibbs-Duhem equation is written as\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - {N_{A}d\\mu}_{A} - {N_{B}d\\mu}_{B} - {N_{C}d\\mu}_{C}$\n\nTaking the component A as the dependent element, the two-phase\nClausius-Clapeyron equation is simplified as\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\frac{{d\\mu}_{B}}{{d\\mu}_{C}} = \\frac{d\\left( \\ln a_{B} \\right)}{d\\left( \\ln a_{C} \\right)} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}z_{C}^{\\alpha\\beta}}{{\\mathrm{\\Delta}z}_{B}^{\\alpha\\beta}}$\n\nWhen the two phases in equilibrium are stoichiometric phases, the\ntwo-phase equilibrium is thus a straight line. For example, the Ti-O-Cl\npotential phase diagram at 600\u00b0C and one atmospheric pressure is shown\nin . Since both O and Cl are volatile components, their activities are\nusually represented by their partial pressures with the pure\nO<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> gas as their respective reference\nstates at the given temperature and pressure.\n\nFigure \u2011: Ti-O-Cl potential phase diagram at 600\u00b0C and one atmospheric\npressure\n\nFor systems with more than three components, the chemical potentials of\none or more components must be fixed in order to obtain a\ntwo-dimensional potential phase diagram similar to the potential phase\ndiagrams discussed above.\n", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "bd5e4695", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Tie-lines and lever rule\n\nIt is self-evident from to Eq. 2\u20114 that while potentials are homogeneous\nin all phases in a heterogeneous system at equilibrium, the molar\nquantities usually have different values in individual phases. This is\nalso stipulated in various Clausius-Clapeyron equations such as to and\nto . The difference in molar quantities thus increases the\ndimensionality of the phase region by the number of potentials replaced\nby their conjugate molar quantities. The maximum dimensionality of a\nphase region is the dimensionality of the phase diagram under\nconsideration. This thus creates a finite space between phases in\nequilibrium in the phase diagram with some axes being molar quantities.\n\nFor an equilibrium system under constant $T$, $P$ and $N_{i}$, the\npotentials in the system and their conjugate molar quantities in each\nphase are all uniquely defined. In a phase diagram with one or more\npotentials replaced by their conjugate molar quantities, two phases in\nequilibrium in a system with $c$ independent components are connected by\na $c$ dimensional line in a *c*+2 dimensional space or\nits$\\ $*c+1*-dimensional projection as discussed in Chapter . These\nlines are called tie-lines and collectively represent a two-phase\nequilibrium region. For a $k$-phase equilibrium, there are total\n$C_{k}^{2} = \\frac{k(k - 1)}{2}$ tie-lines connecting every two phases\nwith $k - 1\\ $of them independent because the number of independent\ntie-lines increases by one with each new phase added. For the invariant\nequilibrium with zero degree of freedom, the number of phases in\nequilibrium is $c + 2$ shown by containing\n$C_{c + 2}^{2} = \\frac{(c + 2)(c + 1)}{2}$ tie-lines with $c + 1$ of\nthem being independent.\n\nInside the space encapsulated by the tie-lines, the axis variables of\nthe phase diagram (a mixture of potentials and molar quantities) can be\nchanged independently without changing the phases in equilibrium and\ntheir properties. Only the relative amounts of individual phases are\nadjusted accordingly to maintain the conservation of the molar\nquantities in the system specified by the molar quantity axes of the\nphase diagram. The geometric feature circumscribing the space\nencapsulated by the tie-lines no longer represents any phase regions,\nbut a boundary between the neighbouring phase regions. Its\ncharacteristics will be discussed in more details in the next few\nsections. As properties in each phase are homogeneous, the values of\nmolar quantities of a system are simply the sum of individual phases and\ncan be represented by the following equation\n\nEq. \u2011 $A_{m} = \\sum_{\\alpha}^{}{f^{\\alpha}A_{m}^{\\alpha}}$\n\nwhere $A_{m}$ and $A_{m}^{\\alpha}$ represent the values of a molar\nquantity of the system and the $\\alpha$ phase, respectively,\n$f^{\\alpha}$ the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase, and the summation\ngoes over all phases in equilibrium with each other. With\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^{}f^{\\alpha} = 1$, can be re-arranged into the following\nequation\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^{}{f^{\\alpha}\\left( {A_{m} - A}_{m}^{\\alpha} \\right)} = 0$\n\nis commonly referred as lever rule. For a two-phase equilibrium of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, it becomes\n\nEq. \u2011\n$f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{A_{m}^{\\beta} - A_{m}}{A_{m}^{\\beta} - A_{m}^{\\alpha}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$f^{\\beta} = \\frac{A_{m}^{\\alpha} - A_{m}}{A_{m}^{\\alpha} - A_{m}^{\\beta}}$\n\nFor a phase diagram with the number of axes being\n$n = \\left( c - n_{s} \\right) + 1$, the number of possible axes being\nmolar quantities is thus $k \\leq n$. There are thus $k$ equations\nsimilar to with one for each molar quantity, $A_{mi}$, resulting in the\nfollowing $k + 1$ equations\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^{}{f^{\\alpha}\\left( {A_{mi} - A}_{mi}^{\\alpha} \\right)} = 0$\n\nEq. \u2011 $1 - \\sum_{\\alpha}^{}f^{\\alpha} = 0$\n\nThe summations in and go over the phases in equilibrium, and the amount\nof each phase is obtained by solving these $k + 1$ equations\nsimultaneously along with the equilibrium conditions.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

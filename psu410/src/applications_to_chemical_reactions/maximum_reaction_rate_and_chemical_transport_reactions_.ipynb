Other examples of such\nreactions include the reduction of a metal oxide in flowing hydrogen,\nthe evaporation of a material in a vacuum, and the deposition of a thin\nfilm by a chemical vapour deposition process. The basic assumption used\nin calculating these maximum reaction rates is that local equilibrium\nexists at the location of the considered reaction.\n\nThis section examines several examples in which maximum reaction rates\nare calculated. The system can typically be divided into three regions:\n(1) the input region, which is usually near room temperature, (2) the\nhigh temperature region in which the primary reaction of interest is\noccurring, and (3) the exit region. Such a system is almost always at\nconstant pressure throughout the system. Since the three regions have\ndifferent temperatures, the key is to use the mass conservation of the\ncarrier gas in all three regions. With the input gas at $T = 298K$ and\n$P = 1atm$, the volume of one mole of ideal gas is\n$0.0244\\left( m^{3} \\right) = 24.4(liter)$. The number of moles of input\ngas flowing through the system can be written as\n\n*Eq. 7\u201117*\n$n_{gas}^{0} = \\frac{Pf_{gas}}{RT} = \\frac{f_{gas}}{24.4} = 0.0409f_{gas}$\n\nwhere $f_{gas}$ is the input gas flow rate in liter per unit time at\n$T = 298K$ and $P = 1atm$, and $R$ the gas constant.\n\nThe first example is the evaporation of water in a flowing stream of dry\nhydrogen. A schematic diagram of the system being considered is given in\n. The goal of the calculation is to determine the maximum rate of\n$H_{2}O(liquid)$ loss, $n_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }$, through vaporization in a\nflowing stream of $H_{2}$, e.g. for generating a given $H_{2}O/H_{2}$\nratio for producing a given $O_{2}$ pressure in a high temperature\nsystem as related to the Ellingham diagram discussed in Chapter . The\nmaximum rate is determined by saturating the $H_{2}$ with the\nequilibrium vapour pressure of $H_{2}O(liquid)$ with the number of moles\nof $H_{2}$ being $n_{H_{2}}^{0} = 0.0409f_{H_{2}}$ and $f_{H_{2}}$ being\nthe input flow rate of $H_{2}$ in liter per unit time.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic diagram of vaporization of water in a flowing stream\nof dry hydrogen\n\nIn the first input region, the total number moles of gas is\n$N = n_{H_{2}}^{0}$. In the second high temperature region with the\ntemperature and pressure being $T_{sys}$ and $P_{sys}$, the total number\nmoles of gas is $N = n_{H_{2}}^{0} + n_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }$, which is the same\nfor the third exit region with $T_{exit}$. To avoid condensation, one\nneeds to maintain $T_{exit} > T_{sys}$. The vapour pressure of $H_{2}O$\nat $T_{sys}$, $P_{H_{2}O\\ }$, can be obtained from equilibrium\nthermodynamic calculations. Since the $H_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ are occupying\nthe same volume at the same temperature, the maximum number of moles\n$H_{2}O$ can be calculated from the following relation based on the\nideal gas law\n\n*Eq. 7\u201118*\n$n_{H_{2}O}^{\\ } = \\frac{P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}{P_{H_{2}}^{\\ }}n_{H_{2}}^{0} = \\frac{P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}{P_{sys}^{\\ } - P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}n_{H_{2}}^{0} = \\frac{P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}{P_{sys}^{\\ } - P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}\\frac{f_{H_{2}}}{24.4}$\n\nFor $P_{sys}^{\\ } = 101325Pa$, one can calculate $P_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }$ and\nplot $\\frac{n_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}{f_{H_{2}}}$ as a function of temperature\nfrom the SSUB database as shown in . The corresponding partial pressure\nratio, $P_{H_{2}O}/P_{H_{2}}$ , is plotted in , which can be used to\ncalculate $P_{O_{2}}^{\\ }$ at any given temperatures. An example is\nshown in with $T_{sys} = 348.15K$ and $P_{H_{2}O}/P_{H_{2}} = 0.607$.\n\nFigure \u2011: Ratio of maximum number of moles $H_{2}O$ with respect to\nhydrogen flow rate, $\\frac{n_{H_{2}O}^{\\ }}{f_{H_{2}}}$, plotted as a\nfunction of temperature.\n\nFigure \u2011: Partial pressure ratio, $P_{H_{2}O}/P_{H_{2}}$, corresponding\nto .\n\nFigure \u2011: Partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{O_{2}}^{\\ }$, as a function of\ntemperature with $T_{sys} = 348.15K$ and $P_{H_{2}O}/P_{H_{2}} = 0.607$.\n\nThe second example is the corrosion of $SiO_{2}$(s) by flowing $H_{2}$\ngas at high temperatures. Considering $T_{sys}^{\\ } = 1700K$,\n$P_{sys}^{\\ } = 101325Pa$, and $f_{H_{2}} = 1\\ liter/min$, the system is\nthus defined with 0.0409 moles of $H_{2}$ and an equilibrium between the\ngas phase and the tridymite $SiO_{2}$. The equilibrium calculation gives\n0.04092 moles of gas with its constitutions as\n$H_{2}:H_{2}O:SiO = 0.998887:4.833 \\bullet 10^{- 4}:4.832 \\bullet 10^{- 4}$.\nThe corrosion rate of SiO<sub>2</sub>(s) is thus\n$0.04092x4.832 \\bullet 10^{- 4} = 1.98 \\bullet 10^{- 5}mol/min = 1.19gram/min.$\n\nAnother example is to consider that the flowing $CO$ gas of 298K and\n1atm ($= 101325Pa$) at a rate of $1\\ liter/min$ passes through and\nequilibrates with single phase $C(s)$ at 1500K. The equilibrium system\nis defined by $T = 1500K$, $P = 1atm$, and 0.0409 moles of $CO$ with the\nequilibrium between the gas phase and C(s). The equilibrium calculation\ngives 0.040872 moles of gas phase with the mole fraction of $CO$ being\n0.999327, resulting in the loss of *CO* or the deposition of *C(s)* at a\nrate of\n$0.0409 - 0.040872 \\bullet 0.999327 = 5.55 \\bullet 10^{- 5}mole/min$.\n\nA chemical transport reaction is a reaction in which a condensed phase\nreacts with a gas phase to form vapour-phase products, which in turn\nundergo the reverse reformation of the condensed phase. Two well-known\nexamples of such reactions are\n\n*Eq. 7\u201119* $M(s) + \\frac{n}{2}I_{2}(g) = MI_{n}(g)$\n\n*Eq. 7\u201120* $Ni(s) + 4CO(g) = Ni{(CO)}_{4}(g)$\n\nwhich are used in the purification of metals by the iodide process and\nin the purification of nickel by the Mond-Langer process. In both\nprocesses the forward reaction is favoured by lower temperatures and the\nreverse reaction by higher temperatures, resulting in the deposition of\nthe metal. The most common technique for causing a chemical transport of\na condensed substance makes use of the temperature dependence of the\nequilibrium constant. As was discussed previously, the enthalpy of\nreaction, $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$, determines the manner in which\n$K_{e}$ changes with temperature (see ). The value of $K_{e}$ increases\nwith increasing *T* for $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H > 0$, $K_{e}$\ndecreases with increasing *T* for $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H < 0$, and\n$K_{e}$ is independent of T for $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H = 0$. The\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$ values for\nchemical transport reactions may be either positive or negative. For\nreactions by both are positive, and for reactions by both are negative.\n\nIn a typical experiment the starting solid is located at the point in a\ntemperature gradient that corresponds to the largest $K_{e}$ value for\nthe experimental condition. As the gaseous species migrate to other\nlocations in the system with temperatures corresponding to lower $K_{e}$\nvalues, the reverse reaction occurs to satisfy the new equilibrium\nrequirements, and the solid phase is deposited. The dependence of\n$K_{e}$ on $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ results in a material transport\nfrom hot to cold for $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H > 0$ (the same as for\nvaporization-condensation reactions), from cold to hot for\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H < 0$, and no transport for\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H = 0$.\n\nThe success of a particular reaction in causing an appreciable transport\nof a condensed phase depends mainly upon the partial pressure gradients\nor concentration gradients of the gaseous species in the system. A\nreaction whose equilibrium is extreme toward either the reactant side or\nthe product side will not give an appreciable transport of material. The\nconcentration gradients are too small in such a system. Reactions with\nequilibrium constants near unity at the experimental temperatures\nusually give the largest transport since small changes in $K_{e}$ cause\nlarge changes in concentrations. The general condition required for\nobtaining a $K_{e}$ value near unity at a reasonable temperature is that\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$ both have\nthe same sign, resulting from the equalities of .\n", "metadata": {}}]}

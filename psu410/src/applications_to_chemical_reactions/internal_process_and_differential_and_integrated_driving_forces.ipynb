For a system under constant $T$ and $P$, let us\nconsider an internal process for forming a new phase $\\alpha$ with the\ncomposition $x_{i}^{\\alpha}$ and Gibbs energy\n$G_{m}^{\\alpha}\\left( x_{i}^{\\alpha} \\right)$. The differential driving\nforce for such an internal process can thus be defined as\n\n*Eq. 7\u20112*\n$- D = G_{m}^{\\alpha}\\left( x_{i}^{\\alpha} \\right) - \\sum_{i}^{}x_{i}^{\\alpha}\\mu_{i} = \\sum_{i}^{}x_{i}^{\\alpha}\\left( \\mu_{i}^{\\alpha} - \\mu_{i} \\right)$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{i}$ is the chemical potential of component *i* in the\nsystem. This may also be called as nucleation driving force as if the\n$\\alpha$ phase is nucleating in the system. As discussed in Chapter ,\nchemical potentials are the intercepts on the Gibbs energy axis by the\ntangent plane of Gibbs energy. thus represents the distance between the\ntangent planes of the original system and the $\\alpha$ phase at the\ncomposition of the $\\alpha$ phase. Evidently, this distance is at its\nmaximum when the two tangent planes are parallel to each other, i.e. the\ncommonly called parallel tangent construction when evaluating nucleation\ndriving force.\n\nThe situation is different for chemical reactions where the amount of\neach component in reactants is the same as that in products, i.e. there\nis a mass balance between reactants and products. The driving force for\na chemical reaction is defined by the Gibbs energy difference between\nthe reactants and products as if all the reactants are transferred to\nthe products. This driving force may thus be called integrated driving\nforce as it describes the energy difference of a system under two\ndifferent states, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 7\u20113*\n$- \\int_{}^{}{Dd\\xi} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}G = \\sum_{p}^{}{n_{p}G_{p}} - \\sum_{r}^{}{n_{r}G_{r}}$\n\nwhere superscripts $p$ and $r$ denote products and reactants, $n_{p}$\nand $n_{r}$ their corresponding moles, $G_{p}$and $G_{r}$ the Gibbs\nenergies in per mole of formula of their respective stoichiometries as\nwritten in the chemical reaction. Conventionally, the products and\nreactants are represented by species or stoichiometric compounds rather\nthan individual phases. This is particularly evident when various\ngaseous species are considered in a chemical reaction. Consequently,\n$G_{p}$and $G_{r}$ in represent the chemical potentials of product and\nreactant species. For species with a fixed composition, its chemical\npotential is the same as its Gibbs energy as shown by . For a species in\na solution phase, its chemical potential is related to its activity as\nshown in . can thus be further written as\n\n*Eq. 7\u20114*\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}G = \\sum_{p}^{}{n_{p}_{\\ }^{0}G_{p}} - \\sum_{r}^{}{n_{r}_{\\ }^{0}G_{r}} + RTln\\frac{\\prod_{p}^{}\\left( a_{p} \\right)^{n_{p}}}{\\prod_{r}^{}\\left( a_{r} \\right)^{n_{r}}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G + RTln\\frac{\\prod_{p}^{}\\left( a_{p} \\right)^{n_{p}}}{\\prod_{r}^{}\\left( a_{r} \\right)^{n_{r}}}$\n\nIt is evident from that for stoichiometric phases in a chemical\nreaction, their activities equal to one. At equilibrium, the integrated\ndriving force becomes zero, i.e. $\\mathrm{\\Delta}G = 0$, and is\nre-arranged to become\n\n*Eq. 7\u20115*\n$- RTln\\frac{\\prod_{p}^{}\\left( a_{p} \\right)^{n_{p}}}{\\prod_{r}^{}\\left( a_{r} \\right)^{n_{r}}} = - RTlnK_{e} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$\n\nwhere $K_{e}$ is often called reaction constant relating the activities\nof products and reactants at equilibrium. In a system with\n$\\frac{\\prod_{p}^{}\\left( a_{p} \\right)^{n_{p}}}{\\prod_{r}^{}\\left( a_{r} \\right)^{n_{r}}} > K_{e}$,\nthe chemical reaction goes to left, and the products are decomposed,\nwhile\n$\\frac{\\prod_{p}^{}\\left( a_{p} \\right)^{n_{p}}}{\\prod_{r}^{}\\left( a_{r} \\right)^{n_{r}}} < K_{e}$,\nthe chemical reaction goes to right, and the products are formed. is\noften recast into the following form by dividing $\u2013RT$ on both sides of\nthe equation\n\n*Eq. 7\u20116*\n$\\ln K_{e} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H}{RT} + \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S}{R}$\n\nWith $\\ln K_{e}$ plotted with respect to $1/T$, indicates that the slope\nis $- \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$/R and the intercept on the y axis is\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}{S/R}$ as shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: $\\ln K_{e}$ plotted with respect to $1/T$ for several M-O\nsystems at 1 bar and $K_{e}$ represented by the partial pressure ratio\nof CO<sub>2</sub> and CO.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

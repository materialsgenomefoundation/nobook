Taking\nthe pure $M$ and the gaseous $O_{2}$ at the reaction temperature and one\natmospheric pressure as their respective reference states, both\nactivities of the pure $M$ solid or liquid phase and its oxide are\nunity, and the activity of $O_{2}$ equals to its partial pressure in an\nideal gas. becomes\n\n*Eq. 7\u20118*\n$RTlnP_{O_{2}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$\n\nBased on , one can plot $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$ as a function of\ntemperature for various oxidation reactions, which is called Ellingham\ndiagram. The intercept at $T = 0K$ is given by\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$, and the slope is represented by\n$- \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$, depicted by the following equation\n\n*Eq. 7\u20119*\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S = S_{M_{4/v_{M}}O_{2}} - S_{O_{2}} - \\frac{4}{v_{M}}S_{M}$\n\nSince the entropy of one mole of $O_{2}$ gas is significantly larger\nthan those of the pure element and its oxide when they are in solid or\nliquid states and the entropy difference between the pure element and\nits oxide, the entropy of reaction is thus dominated by the reduction of\nthe entropy by one mole of $O_{2}$ gas. Consequently, the entropies of\nreaction are approximately the same for most reactions when the pure\nelements and their oxides are solid as seen in where most lines have\nsimilar slopes.\n\nFigure \u2011: Ellingham Diagram for a number of metal-oxide systems.\n\nFor a chemical reaction on the Ellingham diagram at a given temperature,\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G$ can be read from the y-axis of the diagram,\nand the equilibrium partial pressure of $O_{2}$ gas can be calculated\nusing . Alternatively, one can plot the left part of for a given\n$P_{O_{2}}$ as a function of temperature on the Ellingham diagram, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 7\u201110* $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}{G =}RTlnP_{O_{2}}$\n\nThis results in straight lines, representing iso-partial-pressure lines\nof $O_{2}$, with the intercept being zero at $T = 0K$ and slopes of\n$RlnP_{O_{2}}$, which are negative for $P_{O_{2}}$ lower than one\natmospheric pressure (1atm). The values of $P_{O_{2}}$ are marked on the\nsecondary axis on the right of the Ellingham diagram. The intersection\nof the isoactivitiy line and the equilibrium line of the chemical\nreaction thus gives the relation of equilibrium temperature and\nequilibrium partial pressure of $O_{2}$. This is demonstrated in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Intersection of iso-partial-pressure lines of $O_{2}$ and\nequilibrium lines in the Ellingham diagram\n\nFor each chemical reaction in the Ellingham diagram, the three phases\nare in equilibrium on the line represented by , i.e. metal, metal\noxides, and O<sub>2</sub> gas. For conditions above the line, the value\nof $P_{O_{2}}$ is larger than its equilibrium value, and the metal will\nbe oxidized. For conditions below the line, the value of $P_{O_{2}}$ is\nlower than its equilibrium value, and the metal oxide will be reduced.\nTherefore, the metal oxides in the upper part of the Ellingham diagram\ncan be reduced by the metals in the lower part of the diagram, and vice\nversus, metals in the lower part of the diagram can be oxidized by the\nmetal oxides in the upper part of the diagram. For example, in , Ca can\nreduce all oxides, and Cu<sub>2</sub>O is the least stable oxide.\n\nFrom the above Ellingham diagram, it is noted that equilibrium partial\npressures of $O_{2}$ are very low for most chemical reactions with many\nof them lower than $10^{- 12}\\ atm$. One approach to obtain such a low\npressure is to use auxiliary reactions containing $O_{2}$ that are easy\nto control and are independent of the equilibrium system of interest\nexcept the sharing of the oxygen partial pressure. Two common auxiliary\nreactions are the $H_{2}$/$H_{2}O$ and $CO$/$CO_{2}$ mixtures. For the\n$H_{2}$/$H_{2}O$ mixture, the chemical reaction is\n\n*Eq. 7\u201111* $2H_{2}(gas) + O_{2}(gas) = 2H_{2}O(gas)$\n\nThe equilibrium oxygen partial pressure is obtained as\n\n*Eq. 7\u201112*\n$- RTln\\left\\{ {\\frac{1}{P_{O_{2}}}\\left( \\frac{P_{H_{2}O}}{P_{H_{2}}} \\right)}^{2} \\right\\} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S = - 498488\\  + 112.972T\\ (J)$\n\nwhere the $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$\nare taken from the substance thermodynamic database (SSUB4) compiled by\nScientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) \\[59\\], which are slightly\ndependent on temperature, and the values in are evaluated at 1273K using\nThermo-Calc \\[60\\]. At any given temperature, one has the following\nrelation\n\n*Eq. 7\u201113*\n$RTlnP_{O_{2}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S - 2RTln\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} = - 498488 + \\left( 112.972 - 2Rln\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} \\right)T$\n\nIts intercept at $T = 0K$ is given by\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H = - 498,488\\ (J)$, and the slope by\n$- \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S - 2Rln\\left( \\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} \\right) = 112.972 - 2Rln\\left( \\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} \\right)$.\nThe values of the $\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}}$ ratio are marked on\nanother secondary axis on the right of the Ellingham diagram. The\nintersection of the iso-partial-pressure-ratio line and the equilibrium\nline of the chemical reaction gives the relation of equilibrium\ntemperature and equilibrium partial pressure ratio\n$\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}}$ for desired $P_{O_{2}}$ of the chemical\nequilibrium.\n\nFor the $CO$/$CO_{2}$mixture, the chemical reaction is shown below\n\n*Eq. 7\u201114* $2CO(gas) + O_{2}(gas) = 2CO_{2}(gas)$\n\nSimilar, from the SSUB database, the following equation is obtained\n\n*Eq. 7\u201115*\n$- RTln\\left\\{ {\\frac{1}{P_{O_{2}}}\\left( \\frac{P_{{CO}_{2}}}{P_{CO}} \\right)}^{2} \\right\\} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}G = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S = - 562,927 - 172.020T\\ (J)$\n\nwith $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ and $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$\ncalculated at 1273K, which are also slightly temperature-dependent as in\nthe case of the $H_{2}$/$H_{2}O$ mixture. The iso-partial-pressure-ratio\nlines are written as\n\n*Eq. 7\u201116*\n$RTlnP_{O_{2}} = \\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H - T\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S - 2RTln\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}} = - 562,927 + \\left( 172.020 - 2Rln\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}} \\right)T\\ $\n\nIts intercept at $T = 0K$ is given by\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H = - 562,927\\ (J)$, and the slope by\n$172.020 - - 2Rln\\left( \\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}} \\right)$. The values\nof the $\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}}$ ratio are marked on the third\nsecondary axis on the right of the Ellingham diagram. The intersection\nof the iso-partial-pressure-ratio line and the equilibrium line of the\nchemical reaction gives the relation of equilibrium temperature and\nequilibrium partial pressure ratio $\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}}$ for\ndesired $P_{O_{2}}$ of the chemical equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, one can use a mixture of the $H_{2}$/$H_{2}O$ or\n$CO$/$CO_{2}$ to obtain the desired low $P_{O_{2}}$ values using and or\ncalculating from the SSUB database. For example,\n$P_{O_{2}} = 10^{- 15}\\ atm$ at 1273K, the calculated values from the\nSSUB database are $\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} \\approx 1.67$ and\n$\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}} \\approx 2.78$, respectively, in which the\ntemperature dependences of $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}H$ and\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\ }^{0}S$ and the many more gaseous species in the gas\nphase are taken into account. On the other hand, the reading from the\nEllingham diagram gives $\\frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P_{H_{2}O}} \\approx 2.0$ and\n$\\frac{P_{CO}}{P_{{CO}_{2}}} \\approx 2.4$, and the agreement with the\nmore accurate calculations above is remarkable keeping in mind the\nuncertainties in graphically drawing the lines and reading both values\nin the logarithmic scales from the diagram, indicating the robustness of\nthe Ellingham diagram.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

There are a number of\ntheoretical models for Invar such as the Weiss 2-\u03b3 model, the\nnon-collinear spin model, and the disordered local moment approach as\nreviewed in Ref. \\[67\\]. In this section, the application of the MMS\nmodel to the ordered L1<sub>2</sub> Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt is presented to\nstudy the Invar anomaly at finite temperatures.\n\nFor a supercell of 12 atoms with nine magnetic Fe atoms in\nFe<sub>3</sub>Pt, if only the up and down spins are considered, the\nsystem contains 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 spin configurations, which are, by\nsymmetry, reduced to 37 non-equivalent ones. They are the microstates in\nthe MMS model, and FMC and SFC are used to represent the ferromagnetic\nand spin flipping microstates, respectively. For the first-principles\ncalculations of each microstate, VASP package \\[14\\] within the\nprojector-augmented wave (PAW) method and the exchange-correlation part\nof the density functional treated within the GGA of\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) \\[32\\] are employed with details in Ref.\n\\[67\\]. For the lattice vibration, the Debye-Gr\u00fcneisen approach\ndescribed in Chapter 5.2.4 is used.\n\npresents the first-principles 0 K total energies of 36 non-equivalent\nSFCs as well as the FMC as a function of atomic volume. It can be seen\nthat there are a number of SFCs, whose energies are in the range of ~1\nmRy/atom to that of the FMC. It is noted that all the SFCs studied\nherein have the equilibrium averaged atomic volumes at least 1.8 %\nsmaller than that of the FMC, the 0 GPa ground state. In , the two\nlowest energy SFCs have been labeled as SFC55 and SFC41 with their spin\narrangements very similar to the double layer antiferromagnetic state.\nThe nonmagnetic configuration has a very small atomic volume of 11.66\n\u00c5<sup>3</sup>/atom and much higher energy than both FMC and all SFCs,\nand is thus not shown here.\n\nFigure \u2011: 0 K total energies. The heavy black line represents the FMC.\nThe symbols **\u25cb**, \u25d4, \u25d1, and \u25d5 with dashed lines indicate the minima of\nthe energy-volume curves of the SFCs with spin polarization rates of\n1/9, 3/9, 5/9, and 7/9, respectively. The red **\u25cb** and \u25d4 with\ndot-dashed lines mark the two lowest SFCs in energy.\n\nThe normalized Helmholtz energies of all SFCs are plotted in with the\nHelmholtz energy of FMC as the reference state, shown that the FMC has\nthe lowest Helmholtz energy at all temperatures considered. If only the\nrelative Helmholtz energies of microstates are considered, FMC should be\nstable at all temperatures. However, the configurational entropy due to\nthe mixing among multiple microstates, i.e. , lowers the system free\nenergy by introducing the statistic probability of metastable SFCs.\n\nFigure \u2011: Normalized Helmholtz energy of all SFCs with respect to that\nof FMC.\n\nThrough the minimization of Helmholtz energy of , the\ntemperature-pressure and temperature-volume phase diagrams are obtained\nand shown in \\[66\\]. A critical point at 141 K and 5.81 GPa is predicted\nwith *V* = 12.61 \u00c5<sup>3</sup>. Below the critical point, it is a\ntwo-phase miscibility gap (the shadow area) with the dominant\nmicrostates being FMC and SFCs, respectively, and the transition between\nthem is first-order. Above the critical point, the macroscopically\nhomogeneous single phase is stable, and the phase transitions between\nthe ferromagnetic-dominant phase with large volumes and the SFC-dominant\nparamagnetic phase with small volumes are of second-order. The\nsecond-order transition pressures and volumes are determined by the\ncondition that the weighted Helmholtz energy counting all SFCs equals to\nthe Helmholtz energy counting only FMC.\n\nFigure \u2011: Calculated (a) temperature-pressure and (b) temperature-volume\nphase diagrams of Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt.\n\nIn a, the data points are the measured pressure dependence of the Curie\ntemperature, and the agreement between the measurements and predictions\nis remarkable. It should be pointed out that the classical Weiss 2-\u03b3\nmodel predicts only first-order phase transitions while the\nnon-collinear spin model yields only second-order phase transitions at\nall temperatures. In b, four isobaric volume curves are also plotted\nwith the predicted NTE regions marked by the pink open diamonds and the\nexperimental volume data under ambient pressure superimposed, showing\nexcellent agreement. It also depicts the gigantic NTE around the\ncritical point on the isobaric curve at 7 GPa.\n\nindicates that the entropies of SFCs are larger than that of FMC so\ntheir Helmholtz energy differences decrease with temperature. This is in\nline with the origin of NTE in a single phase due to the statistic\nexistence of metastable microstates with lower volumes and higher\nentropies than the stable state in a temperature range where their\nprobabilities change dramatically. plots the calculated thermal\npopulations of the FMC (black solid line) and that of the sum over all\nSFCs (black dot-dashed line) under ambient pressure. The two major\ncontributions to the paramagnetic (PM) phase are from SFC55 and SFC41,\nwhich are also plotted using red dashed and long dashed lines,\nrespectively. The system is dominated by the FMC at temperatures below\nhalf of the transition temperature, and the populations of SFCs increase\nmonotonously at temperatures higher than half of the transition\ntemperature. As mentioned above, the transition temperature is defined\nwhen the population of all SFCs is the same as that of FMC due to their\nequal Helmholtz energy.\n\nFigure \u2011: Calculated thermal populations of FMC, SFC55, SFC41, and sum\nof all SFCS, respectively.\n\nThe predicted thermal volume expansion and the derived linear thermal\nexpansion coefficient (LTEC) under ambient pressure are plotted in . A\npositive thermal expansion is predicted from 100 K to 288 K, followed by\na negative thermal expansion in the range of 289 ~ 449 K, and then a\npositive thermal expansion again at \\>450 K, in excellent agreement with\nexperiments. The only disagreement between the predictions and\nexperiments occur at T \\< 100 K where the calculations did not reproduce\nthe negative thermal expansion for Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt. Large supercell or\nmore spin configurations may be needed.\n\nFigure \u2011: (a) Relative volume increase (V-\nV<sub>300</sub>)/V<sub>300</sub> with V<sub>300</sub> being the\nequilibrium volume at 300K and 0 GPa for the ordered Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt.\n(b) Linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) along with experimental\ndata (symbols) with details in Ref. \\[67\\].\n", "metadata": {}}]}

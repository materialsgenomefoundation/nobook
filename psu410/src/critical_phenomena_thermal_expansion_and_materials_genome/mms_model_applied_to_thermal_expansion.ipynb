Let us carry out a virtual experiment by analyzing a system\nstarting with one microstate only, *\u03b1*, when the metastable *\u03b2*\nmicrostate has a higher entropy than the *\u03b1* microstate, i.e. and the\nrelative stability of the *\u03b2* microstate thus increases with\ntemperature. The cases with will be discussed after this starting with a\nmixture of the *\u03b1* and *\u03b2* microstates.\n\nWhen a metastable microstate, *\u03b2*, is introduced by changing pressure\nunder constant temperature, based on and , the entropy change of the\nsystem can be written as\n\nEq. 9\u20111\n\nwhere represents the statistic probability of the microstate in the\nsystem. With , this would results in a positive entropy change of , i.\ne. , since . If this entropy increase is due to the decrease of\npressure, i.e. because volume and its conjugate potential (negative\npressure) change in the same direction, the volume thermal expansion of\nthe system is positive due to the increase of the population of the *\u03b2*\nmicrostate with a larger volume. In this case,\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}} > 0$, and the\nvolume and entropy of the two microstates change in the same direction.\n\nOn the other hand, if this entropy increase is realized by increasing\npressure, i.e. , the volume thermal expansion of the system is negative\ndue to the increase of the population of the *\u03b2* microstate with a\nsmaller volume. In this case,\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}} < 0$, and the\nvolume and entropy of the two microstates change in the opposite\ndirections.\n\nTherefore, the sign of\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}}$ of two\nmicrostates can be used as a criterion to determine whether a system\npossesses NTE, i.e. positive\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}}$ for positive\nthermal expansion, and negative\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}}$ for NTE. At a\ncritical point, the entropy change with respect to temperature is\ninfinite, resulting in either infinite positive or infinite negative\nthermal expansion correspondingly. When the system moves away from the\ncritical point into the macroscopically homogeneous single-phase region,\nthe thermal expansion becomes less positive or negative. A number of\nsystems with\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}} < 0$, thus\npotentially NTE, are listed in the supplementary information of Ref.\n\\[63\\].\n\nNow let us consider the case that the metastable *\u03b2* microstate has\nlower entropy than the *\u03b1* microstate, i.e. , and the *\u03b2* microstate is\nthus more stable at low temperatures. The system at higher temperatures\ncontains thus only the *\u03b1* microstate and has positive thermal\nexpansion. When the metastable *\u03b2* microstate is introduced, the sign of\nthe entropy change in can be either positive or negative because the\nfirst term is negative and the second term is positive, and its sign\nthus depends on the value of the entropy difference between two\nmicrostates and the probability of the metastable *\u03b2* microstate. The\nvirtual experiment should thus be carried out in a system with the\nhighest MCE in , i.e. when the two microstates have the same free energy\nand are in equilibrium with each other. From and , the system entropy\ncan be written as\n\nEq. 9\u20112\n\nWith the change of pressure, will either increase or decrease, and the\nentropy of the system becomes\n\nEq. 9\u20113\n\nThe difference of and is obtained as\n\nEq. 9\u20114\n\nThe second term in is always negative, and the first term is also\nnegative if because . It is thus evident that if is increased by\ndecreasing pressure, the entropy of the system decreases, and the system\nwould possess negative thermal expansion because is negative, and the\nentropy is reduced by the decrease of pressure. At the same time, and\n$\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}} < 0$, the latter\nbeing the same condition for a negative thermal expansion as in the\nfirst virtual experiment with . One can thus conclude that for a\ntwo-phase equilibrium line with\n$\\frac{dT}{dP} = \\frac{\\Delta V^{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta S^{\\alpha\\beta}} < 0$,\nboth phases can display negative thermal expansion. On the other hand,\nif is increased by increasing pressure, the system would possess\npositive thermal expansion because the entropy is reduced by the\nincrease of pressure.\n\nFurthermore, the thermal expansion of a system can be approximated as\nfollows using the rule of mixture of volumes\n\nEq. 9\u20115\n\nEq. 9\u20116\n\nwhere , , , , , and are the thermal expansion coefficients and volumes\nof the system and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 microstates, respectively. For\nsimplification, let us assume both microstates have similar positive\nthermal expansion, i.e. , and becomes\n\nEq. 9\u20117\n\nshows that it is the combination of volume difference and that\ndetermines the macroscopic thermal expansion. By setting , one obtains\n\nEq. 9\u20118\n\nFor , for $p^{\\beta} \\geq 0$, and for , at $p^{\\beta} \\rightarrow 0$ .\nThe readers are reminded that the sign of is the same as the sign of .\n", "metadata": {}}]}

This involves a magnetic, high temperature/high volume\n\u201c\u03b3-phase\u201d and a nonmagnetic, low temperature/low volume \u201c\u03b1-phase\u201d, both\nin the same face-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice structure. At 298 K and\n0.7 GPa, the \u03b3\u2192\u03b1 transition is accompanied by a 14-17% volume collapse.\nThe Ce phase transition has been studied extensively including our own\nworks with two or three microstates \\[55, 64\\].\n\nThe simplest model for the system is to consider two microstates:\nferromagnetic and nonmagnetic. The first-principles calculations of the\nfree energy of two Ce microstates are problematic in the absence of\nstrong correlation of the *f*-electrons in the DFT Hamiltonian. The\nrelative stability of the nonmagnetic (\u201cdelocalized\u201d) Ce 4*f* state to\nthat of the magnetic (\u201clocalized\u201d) Ce 4*f* state is greatly\noverestimated in the GGA \\[31-32\\] with spin polarization. The usual\napproach to surmount this is the Dudarev DFT + U method \\[65\\] with the\non-site Coulomb and exchange interactions as described with a\nHartree-Fock approximation added to the DFT Hamiltonian. This method\noffers the advantage that only the difference between the Hubbard U (due\nto the energy increase from an electron addition to a specific site) and\nthe J (due to the screened exchange energy) need to be specified *a\npriori*.\n\nEvaluation of numerous U \u2013 J values over a 1.0 \u2013 6.0 eV range revealed\nthat 1.6 eV gives the most consistent prediction of nonmagnetic Ce and\nmagnetic Ce energetics over the range of atomic volumes that includes\nboth microstates at 0 K. The energy-volume curves thus obtained is\nplotted in , showing that the nonmagnetic microstate is the ground\nstate, and the equilibrium between the two microstates at 0 K is at the\nnegative pressure of -0.87GPa. Since and , NTE does not exist in the\nsystem.\n\nFigure \u2011: Variation of cell energy (eV) with atomic volume\n(\u00c5<sup>3</sup>) for Ce computed with strong correlation based upon\nDudarev\u2019s method with U \u2013 J = 1.6 eV.\n\nTo take into account the possible magnetic disordering in the\nferromagnetic microstate at finite temperatures, the following\ncontribution is added to the free energy of the ferromagnetic microstate\n\nEq. 9\u20119\n\nwhere *M<sub>S</sub>* is the spin moment, and *l* = 3 the orbital\nangular momentum of an *f*-electron. is a generalization of Hund\u2019s rule,\nwith total angular momentum . The Helmholtz energies thus obtained for\nboth microstates and the system are shown in at several temperatures\nwith the tie-lines included. In the figure, the blue, dot-dashed curves\nare for the nonmagnetic microstate, red, solid curves for ferromagnetic\nmicrostate, cyan shadows for entropy of mixing between two microstates,\nand the circle in (e) is the critical point. The numbers below the black\ndashed line, representing the common tangent curves, mark the transition\npressures. The 0-K static energies of the nonmagnetic microstate and the\nmagnetic microstate are also plotted in (a) using the solid circles and\ndotted lines.\n\nFigure \u2011: Helmholtz energies at (a) 0 K; (b) 100 K; (c) 165 K; (d) 300\nK; (e) 476 K; and (f) 600 K.\n\nThe temperature vs volume phase diagram is plotted and compared with\navailable experimental data as shown in \\[66\\]. In this figure, the\nvolume (V) is normalized to its equilibrium volume (V<sub>N</sub>) at\natmospheric pressure and room temperature. In the pressure range of 2.25\n\u2013 3.5 GPa, the system is within the single-phase region at all\ntemperatures considered as shown by the five continuous isobaric volumes\nas a function of temperature. In this pressure range, normal thermal\nexpansion is observed at both low and high temperatures on each isobaric\ncurve where the probability of each microstate does not change\nsignificantly with temperature. While in the middle temperature range on\neach isobaric curve, the colossal positive thermal expansion (CPTE),\nhighlighted by the pink open diamond symbols, exists due to the fast\nincrease of probability of the metastable ferromagnetic microstate with\nrespect to temperature, i.e. , , and . This CPTE is much higher than the\nindividual positive thermal expansions of the stable and metastable\nmicrostates, respectively.\n\nFigure \u2011: Calculated temperature-volume phase diagram of Ce.\n\nWith decreasing pressure, the system reaches a critical point (green\ncircle) where the homogeneous single phase becomes unstable, represented\nby and , and both entropy and volume change infinitely. At even lower\npressure, a miscibility gap forms, and the single phase separates into\ntwo phases with the same fcc crystal structures, but different magnetic\nspin structures. Inside the miscibility gap, the volume changes\ndiscontinuously with respect to temperature by the so-called first-order\ntransition as shown by the isobaric curve at zero pressure, compared\nwell with experimental volume data (solid squares) under ambient\npressure.\n\nThe fraction of the ferromagnetic microstate, *x*<sup>mag</sup>, in \u03b1-Ce\n(blue) and \u03b3-Ce (red) calculated using is plotted in as a function of\npressure along the miscibility gap phase boundary. It can be seen that\nthe fraction of the ferromagnetic microstate in \u03b1-Ce increases with\nincreasing pressure while the fraction of the ferromagnetic microstate\nin \u03b3-Ce decreases. At the critical point, the fraction of ferromagnetic\nmicrostate is calculated to be 0.58. This is in qualitative agreement\nwith the 0.67 value (filled circle) estimated experimentally at the\ncritical point.\n\nFigure \u2011: Fraction of ferromagnetic microstate in \u03b1-Ce (blue) and \u03b3-Ce\n(red) along the \u03b3-\u03b1 phase boundary.\n\nThe relative volume, *V/V<sub>N</sub>*, as a function of pressure, is\nplotted as the black solid lines in from 200 to 600 K at 50 K\nincrements. The blue and red solid lines correspond to \u03b1-Ce and \u03b3-Ce,\nrespectively. Symbols denote experimental data in the literature, except\nthe open green circle being the calculated critical point, in good\nagreement with the computed isotherms. In the two-phase miscibility gap\nregion, the \u03b3\u2192\u03b1 volume collapse is again noted, with the magnitude of\nthe collapse increasing with decreasing *T*. This is shown explicitly by\nthe dashed vertical lines at *T* = 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 K.\nFor *T* \\> 476 K, the calculated isotherms show an anomalous slope\nchange which closely matches the behavior near *V/V<sub>N</sub>* = ~0.85\nfrom experiment.\n\nFigure \u2011: Equation-of-states for Ce. The black solid lines represent the\ncalculated isotherms from 200 to 600 K at \u2206T = 50 K increments.\n\nA more complex model is to add the anti-ferromagnetic microstate. Thus\nobtained E-V and Helmholtz energy curves at 0 K are shown in . The\nequilibrium volume energies reveal that the energy of the\nanti-ferromagnetic microstate at the equilibrium volume is close to that\nof the nonmagnetic microstate but substantially lower than that of the\nferromagnetic microstate. It should be noted that the magnetic spin\ndisordering in the system is taken into account by the two magnetic\nmicrostates, and the contribution denoted by the mean-field theory, i.e.\n, should thus not be added to either magnetic microstate to avoid double\ncounting. The predicted critical point values are 546 K and 2.05 GPa,\ncloser to the experimental data than the previous predication with two\nmicrostates as shown in the temperature-pressure phase diagram in in\ncomparison with experimental data.\n\nFigure \u2011: (a) dot-dashed line with **\u25cb** (red), dashed line **\u25d1**\n(blue), and solid line with \u25cf (blue) represent the 0 K static total\nenergies for nonmagnetic (NM), anti-ferromagnetic (AFM), and\nferromagnetic (FM) microstates of Ce, respectively. (b) The solid lines\ndenote Helmholtz energy (per atom) from 0 to 600 K at \u2206T = 100 K; the\nheavy dot-dashed (\u03b1-Ce, red) and solid (\u03b3-Ce, blue) looping curves\nenclose the two-phase region with the light red dot-dashed lines\nconnecting the common tangents of each isotherm; the black dashed line\ndenotes zero pressure equilibrium state at given T; **\u25cb** (red) and \u25cf\n(blue) emphasize the phase boundary at 300 K while **\u25d1** (green) is the\ncritical point.\n\nFigure \u2011: Calculated temperature-pressure phase diagram along with\nexperimental data.\n\nThe calculated entropy changes are plotted in a in terms of lattice\nvibration only (black dashed line), lattice vibration plus thermal\nelectron (black dot-dashed line), and lattice vibration plus thermal\nelectron and plus configuration coupling (solid blue). The black square\nis the estimated vibrational entropy change at 0.7 GPa of \u03b3-Ce relative\nto \u03b1-Ce, and other open (solid) symbols are from experimental\nmeasurements of total entropy. Various contributions to the Helmholtz\nenergy along the \u03b3-\u03b1 phase boundary are plotted in b in terms of *T\u2206S*\n(blue diamonds), *\u2206E* (green circles), and *P\u2206V* (red squares), shown\nexcellent agreement with experimental data.\n\nFigure \u2011: Calculated (a) entropy; (b) various contributions to Helmholtz\nenergy of Ce along with experimental data.\n\nThe predicted fractions of three microstates as a function of\ntemperature and heat capacity at the critical pressure of 2.05 Pa are\nshown in a and b, respectively. Near the critical point, the theory\npredicts that the system is a mixture of the various microstates. a\ndepicts that for T \\< 300 K, the system consists mainly of the\nnonmagnetic Ce state which results in \u03b1-Ce. For *T* \\> 300 K, the\nthermal populations of the magnetic states increase with increasing\ntemperature. Finally, for *T* \\> 546 K (the critical point), 70% of the\nsystem is composed of the antiferromagnetic Ce state with the remaining\n30% consisting of the nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic Ce states. This is\nin agreement with the common belief that \u03b3-Ce is magnetic with a\npartially disordered local moment (paramagnetic) and that \u03b1-Ce is\nnonmagnetic.\n\nb shows the predicted temperature evolution of contributions to heat\ncapacity: vibrational and magnetic (*C<sub>f</sub>/T*), electronic\n(*C<sub>el</sub>*/*T*), and their sum (*C<sub>f+el</sub>/T*) at 2.05\nGPa. The theory suggests the following: (a) below ~500 K,\n*C<sub>f+el</sub>/T* shows an exponential temperature dependence due to\nthe statistic fluctuation among the non-magnetic, ferromagnetic, and\nantiferromagnetic states; (b) a peak appears at ~500 K in the\n*C<sub>f+el</sub>/T* curve, which typically suggests the Schottky\nanomaly; (c) the electronic specific heat coefficient\n(*C<sub>el</sub>*/*T*) is linear against *T*; (d) above *~*500 K the sum\nof *C<sub>f</sub>/T* and *C<sub>el</sub>*/*T* renders\n*C<sub>f+el</sub>/T* temperature-independent.\n\nFigure \u2011: (a) Thermal populations of the nonmagnetic (red dot-dashed),\nanti-ferromagnetic (green dashed), and ferromagnetic (blue solid) as a\nfunction of temperature at the critical pressure of 2.05 GPa.

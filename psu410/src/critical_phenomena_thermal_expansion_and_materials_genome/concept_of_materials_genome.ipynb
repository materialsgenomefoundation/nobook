The word\ngenome, when applied in nonbiological contexts, connotes a fundamental\nbuilding block toward a larger purpose\u201d \\[68\\]. Materials Genome\u00ae (a\ntrademark of Materials Genome, Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) thus concerns\nthe building blocks of materials. Most part of this book focuses on the\nGibbs/Helmholtz energies of individual phases as a function of its\nnatural variables, and the same in the CALPHAD modeling of\nthermodynamics and other properties of individual phases.\nMulti-component materials systems and their properties are built on the\nindividual phases and their properties. Individual phases are thus\nnaturally considered as building blocks of materials. Consequently, the\nlanguage of CALPHAD thermodynamics and kinetics contains the genomics of\nmaterials by representing experimental and theoretical results in\ndatabases to make them applicable to a much wider context than the\noriginal experiments or calculations \\[69\\]. The change of individual\nphases in terms of their properties, amounts, and interactions with\nother phases with respect to external conditions thus determines the\nperformance of the materials.\n\nOn the other hand, at critical points and beyond, phases lose their\nindividuality and form one macroscopically homogeneous system, and the\nproperties of the system change dramatically with respect to external\nconditions. As shown in this chapter, these dramatically responses can\nbe predicted through the statistic competition of stable and metastable\nmicrostates. From the thermodynamic point of view, under any given\nconditions, one of the individual microstate has the lowest\nGibbs/Helmholtz energy and is stable, while all other microstates have\nhigher free energy and are metastable or unstable. These metastable or\neven unstable microstates are brought into statistic existence in the\nmatrix of the stable microstate due to the entropy of mixing of the\nstable and metastable configurations. Those microstates may thus be\nconsidered as the building blocks of individual phases \\[70\\].\n\nIt has demonstrated in this chapter that the properties of a\nmacroscopically homogeneous system with multiple microstates are not a\nlinear combination of properties of constituent microstates and depends\nsignificantly on the change rate of statistic probability of microstates\nwith respect to external fields. This change rate is determined by the\nfree energy difference between the stable and metastable microstates and\nits change with respect to external fields. As shown in and , this\nchange rate can be correlated to the distance of the system with respect\nto the critical point in the system. At the critical point, there is a\nmathematical singularity when the single phase becomes unstable. When\nthe macroscopically homogeneous single-phase system moves away from the\ncritical point, its properties become less and less dramatic, but always\nremain a certain degree of anomaly. The properties of a system can thus\nbe dramatically altered and designed by changing the position of the\ncritical point through adjustments of chemical compositions and strain\nenergy in thin films.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

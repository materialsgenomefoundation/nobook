As illustrated by , even though\neach molar quantity changes in the same direction as its conjugate\npotential, i.e. with the same sign, its dependence with respect to a\nnonconjugate potentials can either be in the same sign or opposite\nsigns. It is often considered to be normal when they change in the same\ndirection, while abnormal when in different directions.\n\nIn this chapter, the thermal expansion defined by , is used as an\nexample for detailed discussion of those extraordinary phenomena in the\ncontext of a critical point based on the MMS model presented in Chapter\n. The MMS model is first discussed in terms of thermal expansion and\nthen applied to elemental cerium (Ce) with the colossal positive thermal\nexpansion (CPTE) and Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt with negative thermal expansion\n(NTE).\n", "metadata": {}}]}

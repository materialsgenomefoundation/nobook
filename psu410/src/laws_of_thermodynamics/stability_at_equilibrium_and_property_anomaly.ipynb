To study the stability of the equilibrium\nstate, one considers the entropy production due to a fluctuation of a\nmolar quantity as an internal process. Based on the second law of\nthermodynamics, the driving force, as the first derivative of the\nentropy production with respect to the internal process, is zero for\nsuch a fluctuation at equilibrium, i.e. *D*=0, and the entropy of\nproduction thus depends on the second derivative. It can be written as\nfollows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$Td_{ip}S = \\frac{\\partial_{ip}S}{\\partial\\xi}d\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}{\\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{2}S}{\\partial\\xi^{2}}(d\\xi)}^{2} = Dd\\xi - \\frac{1}{2}D_{2}(d\\xi)^{2}$\n\nwith $D_{2} = - \\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{2}S}{\\partial\\xi^{2}}$. When\n$\\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{2}S}{\\partial\\xi^{2}} < 0$ or $D_{2} > 0$ along\nwith $D = 0$, the fluctuation does not produce positive entropy of\nproduction and can thus not develop further. The equilibrium state of\nthe system is therefore stable against the fluctuation. On the other\nhand, when $\\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{2}S}{\\partial\\xi^{2}} > 0$ or\n$D_{2} < 0$ along with $D = 0$, the fluctuation creates positive entropy\nof production and can continue to grow. The equilibrium state of the\nsystem is therefore unstable against the fluctuation. In connection with\n, one can realize that for a system at stable equilibrium without heat\nand mass exchanges with the surroundings, its entropy is at its maximum,\nand there are no other internal processes, which could produce any more\nentropy. This is schematically shown in .\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic diagram showing maximum entropy\n\nUsing , , and , the combined law of thermodynamics can be written as\n\n*Eq. 1\u201133*\n$dU = \\sum_{}^{}{Y_{i}dX_{i}} - Dd\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}D_{2}(d\\xi)^{2}$\n\nLet us carry out the same virtual internal experiment shown in Chapter ,\ni.e. moving an infinitesimal amount of *X<sub>i</sub>* in a homogenous\nsystem with other $X_{j}$ kept constant in an isolated system, i.e.\n$dU = 0$ and $D = 0$. The internal energy change due to this internal\nprocess is\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = \\frac{1}{2}D_{2}\\left\\{ \\left( dX_{i}^{'} \\right)^{2} + \\left( dX_{i}^{\"} \\right)^{2} \\right\\}$\n\nFor a homogeneous system in a state of stable equilibrium with\n$\\left( dX_{i}^{'} \\right)^{2} = \\left( dX_{i}^{\"} \\right)^{2} = \\left( dX_{i} \\right)^{2}$,\nthis internal process must result in an increase of internal energy,\n$dU > 0$, and thus gives\n\nEq. \u2011\n$D_{2} = 2\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}U}{\\partial\\left( X_{i} \\right)^{2}} \\right)_{X_{j}} = 2\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}} > 0$\n\nshows that for a system to be stable, any pair of conjugate variables\nmust change in the same direction when other independent molar\nquantities are kept constant. For the conjugate variables discussed so\nfar, it means that for a stable system, the addition of entropy\nincreases temperature with $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial S}$\\>0, the\nvolume decreases with pressure or increases with the negative of\npressure with $\\frac{\\partial( - P)}{\\partial V} > 0$, and the chemical\npotential of a component increases with its amount, i.e.\n$\\frac{\\partial\\mu_{i}}{\\partial N_{i}} > 0$, where the derivatives are\ntaken with all other molar quantities kept constant. The limit of\nstability is reached when becomes zero, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$D_{2} = 2\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}} = 0$\n\nshows schematically the energy as a function of configurations including\nthree states: unstable, stable, and metastable. Both the stable and\nmetastable states have positive curvatures due to $D_{2} > 0$, while the\nunstable state has a negative curvature due to $D_{2} < 0$. There is an\ninflection point of $D_{2} = 0$ for a state between a stable or\nmetastable state with $D_{2} > 0$ and an unstable state with\n$D_{2} < 0$. These two inflection points, called spinodal, represent the\nlimit of stability. The states between the two inflection points are\nunstable, and other states are either stable or metastable. The two\ninflection points can move apart from or close to each other depending\non the change of external conditions, i.e. the natural variables. One\nextreme situation is when these two inflection points merge into one\npoint, and the instability occurs only at this particular point. It is\nevident that all three states, stable, metastable, and unstable, also\nmerge into one point. This point is called critical or consolute point,\nbeyond which the instability no longer exists.\n\nFigure \u2011: Schematic diagram showing the stable and unstable equilibrium\nstates\n\nTo mathematically define the consolute point, the third derivative needs\nto be added to because both $D$ and $D_{2}$ vanish at this point, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011\n$Td_{ip}S = \\frac{\\partial_{ip}S}{\\partial\\xi}d\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}{\\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{2}S}{\\partial\\xi^{2}}(d\\xi)}^{2} + \\frac{1}{6}{\\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{3}S}{\\partial\\xi^{3}}(d\\xi)}^{3} = Dd\\xi - \\frac{1}{2}D_{2}(d\\xi)^{2} + \\frac{1}{6}{D_{3}(d\\xi)}^{3}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dU = \\sum_{}^{}{Y_{i}dX_{i}} - Dd\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}D_{2}(d\\xi)^{2} - \\frac{1}{6}{D_{3}(d\\xi)}^{3}$\n\nAt the consolute point, the third derivative also becomes zero, i.e.\n\nEq. \u2011 $D_{3} = \\frac{\\partial_{ip}^{3}S}{\\partial\\xi^{3}}^{3} = 0$\n\nLet us further discuss the properties of the system in relation to the\ncritical point. By taking the inverse of the equation of the limit of\nstability, , one obtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial Y_{i}} \\right)_{X_{j}} = + \\ \\infty$\n\ni.e. all $X_{i}$ quantities diverge at the critical point. Therefore,\nwhen a system approaches the critical point from its stable region, the\nchange of a molar quantity with respect to its conjugate potential\nvaries dramatically and becomes infinite at the critical point,\nresulting in property anomalies in the system. In the unstable region,\nthe system would thus separate into stable subsystems and becomes\nheterogeneous, and $X_{i}$:s change discontinuously between subsystems.\nWhile in the stable region, the change of a molar quantity with respect\nto its conjugate potential decreases as the system moves away from the\ncritical point and remains positive due to the stability criteria\ndenoted by .\n\nHowever, it is not clear how a molar quantity changes with respect to a\nnon-conjugate potential at the critical point. From the Maxwell\nrelation, one has\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{i}}{\\partial X_{j}} \\right)_{X_{k \\neq j}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}U}{\\partial X_{i}\\partial X_{j}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y_{j}}{\\partial X_{i}} \\right)_{X_{k \\neq i}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{j}}{\\partial Y_{i}} \\right)_{X_{k \\neq j}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial Y_{j}} \\right)_{X_{k \\neq i}}$\n\nSince all $X_{i}$:s diverge at the critical point, both derivatives in\nshould also go to infinite at the critical point. To investigate their\nsigns, let us carry out a virtual experiment similar to the one in\nderiving the stability condition ( and ). In this case, two internal\nprocesses are needed for moving two molar quantities simultaneously in\nan isolated system, i.e.\n\n*Eq. 1\u201143*\n$dU = - D_{\\xi_{1}}d\\xi_{1} - D_{\\xi_{2}}d\\xi_{2} + D_{\\xi_{1}\\xi_{2}}d\\xi_{1}d\\xi_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}D_{2\\xi_{1}}\\left( d\\xi_{1} \\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}D_{2\\xi_{2}}\\left( d\\xi_{2} \\right)^{2}$\n\nBased on the above discussions, in a stable system at equilibrium with\n$D_{\\xi_{1}} = D_{\\xi_{2}} = 0$, $D_{2\\xi_{1}} > 0$ and\n$D_{2\\xi_{2}} > 0$, the sign of $D_{\\xi_{1}\\xi_{2}}$ cannot be\nunambiguously determined in keeping the change of internal energy\npositive, i.e. $dU > 0$. This indicates that the quantities in can be\neither positive or negative in the stable region and become zero at the\ncritical point. By the same token, the quantities in can be either\npositive or negative and become positive or negative infinite at the\ncritical point.\n\nA profound conclusion from this analysis is that in a stable system even\nthough a molar quantity always changes in the same direction as its\nconjugate potential, the same molar quantity may change in the opposite\ndirection of a non-conjugate potential, resulting in additional\nanomalies represented by Eq. 1\u201140. One example of is the thermal\nexpansion in a closed system, i.e. $dN_{i} = 0$, as follows\n\nEq. \u2011\n$\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} \\right)_{S} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial( - P)} \\right)_{V}$\n\nThe left-hand side of can be understood as follows: with the increase of\ntemperature, the system regulates its pressure in order to keep the\nentropy from increasing, which results in the volume change of the\nsystem. The behavior of the system depends on whether the pressure\ndecreases or increases in order to maintain the entropy of the system\nconstant. If the pressure decreases to maintain the entropy of the\nsystem constant, the volume would increase with the increase of\ntemperature, i.e. the left-hand side of the equation has a positive\nsign, which is also shown by the right-hand side of the equation as the\nchanges of $S$ and $\u2013P$ have the same sign. That the volume increases\nwith temperature is the normal scenario. On the other hand, if the\npressure increases to maintain the entropy of the system constant, the\nvolume would decrease with the increase of temperature, resulting in a\nnegative sign for the left-hand side of the equation. This decrease of\nvolume with the increase of temperature is usually considered to be\nanomalous, originated from the increase of entropy by the decrease of\n$\u2013P$ or the increase of pressure. More discussions on entropy will\nfollow in Chapter 5.2.5 and Chapter 9.\n", "metadata": {}}]}

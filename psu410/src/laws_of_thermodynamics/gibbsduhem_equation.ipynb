It is thus\ndesirable to construct new functions to represent the system with *T*\nand *-P* as natural variables of the functions. One of them is enthalpy\ndefined in , and other two can be defined as follows\n\nEq. \u2011 $F = U - TS$\n\nEq. \u2011 $G = U - TS + PV = \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}N_{i} = H - TS = F + PV$\n\nwith *F* and *G* called Helmholtz energy and Gibbs energy, respectively.\nThe middle part of is obtained using $U$ from . The corresponding\ncombined law of thermodynamics in terms of *H*, *F*, and *G* can be\nobtained through the Legendre transformation of as\n\nEq. \u2011 $dH = TdS - Vd( - P) + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi$\n\nEq. \u2011 $dF = - SdT - PdV + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi$\n\nEq. \u2011 $dG = - SdT - Vd( - P) + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi$\n\nThe independent variables in each of the above form are regarded as the\nnatural variables to the corresponding function. The integral forms of\nall the functions can thus be written as the following with their\nnatural variables listed in the parenthesis\n\nEq. \u2011 $U = U\\left( S,V,N_{i},\\xi \\right)$\n\nEq. \u2011 $H = H\\left( S, - P,N_{i},\\xi \\right)$\n\nEq. \u2011 $F = F\\left( T,V,N_{i},\\xi \\right)$\n\nEq. \u2011 $G = G\\left( T, - P,N_{i},\\xi \\right)$\n\nBy differentiating , one obtains\n\nEq. \u2011\n$dG = \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} + \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}d\\mu}_{i} = - SdT - Vd( - P) + \\sum_{}^{}\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i} - Dd\\xi$\n\nFor a system at equilibrium, $Dd\\xi = 0$, re-arranging gives the\nGibbs-Duhem equation\n\nEq. \u2011 $0 = - SdT - Vd( - P) - \\sum_{}^{}{N_{i}d\\mu}_{i}$\n\nThis equation indicates that for a homogeneous system with *c*\nindependent components at equilibrium, there is a direct relation among\nall the *c+2* potentials, and they are $c$ chemical potentials\n($\\mu_{i}$), temperature, and pressure. Consequently, only *c+1*\npotentials can change independently, and the remaining potential is\ndependent on the other potentials. As discussed in connection with ,\nthere are $c + 2$ independent variables for an equilibrium system with\n*c* independent components, where all of them are molar quantities.\n\nWith the relationships between potentials and molar quantities defined\nby to , one can switch between potentials and molar quantities as\nnatural variables of the system. For example, one can define a new free\nenergy function when the chemical potential of one component is\ncontrolled from the surroundings instead of its content and obtain the\nfollowing combined first and second law of thermodynamics\n\nEq. \u2011 $\\Phi = G - \\mu_{1}N_{1} = \\sum_{i = 2}^{c}{\\mu_{i}N_{i}}$\n\nEq. \u2011\n$d\\Phi = - SdT - Vd( - P) - N_{1}{d\\mu}_{1} + \\sum_{i = 2}^{c}{\\mu_{i}{dN}_{i}} - Dd\\xi$\n\nHowever, even though the $c + 2$ molar quantities are independent of\neach other, indicates that not all the $c + 2$ potentials are\nindependent, i.e., if chemical potentials of all components are changed\nto natural variables, one would obtain . Therefore, among the *c+2*\nindependent variables used to define the system, the maximum number of\nindependent potential is *c+1*, and at least one of the *c+2*\nindependent variables must be a molar quantity. This variable is usually\nchosen to be the size of the system or the major element in the system.\nThe Gibbs-Duhem equation is used to derive Gibbs phase rule in\nheterogeneous systems, which is discussed in Chapter of the book.\n", "metadata": {}}]}
